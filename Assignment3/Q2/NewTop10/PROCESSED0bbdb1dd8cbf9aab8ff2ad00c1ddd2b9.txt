WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: WWE TITLE MATCH, A CHAMPION CELEBRATES, DEAN AND CORBIN
ARE NOT FINISHED, AND MORE

   By [19]Richard Trionfo on 2017-02-14 21:59:00

   We start off with a look at Sunday night's Elimination Chamber pay per
   view that saw Bray Wyatt become the new WWE Champion and Naomi won the
   Smackdown Women's Title.

   We are in Anaheim, California and your announcers are Mauro Ranallo,
   David Otunga, and John Layfield.  Your host is Tom Phillips.

   The new WWE Champion, Bray Wyatt makes his way to the ring, and he is
   alone tonight.

   Before Bray speaks, we are reminded that John Cena gets his rematch
   tonight.

   Bray says that she never said this would be easy.  She said they will
   lie to you.  They will denounce you.  They will try to take away your
   gift and she was right.  Sister Abigail speaks the truth and so does
   he.  When he says that he knew this day was coming, it is not a lie.
   Bray says he has the whole damn world in his hand.

   Bray says too much power can be a very very scary thing, but not for
   him.  It would be bad for all of you.  Bray says open your ears and he
   will sing a beautiful melody.  He says he will lead you to paradise.
   Stand in his way and you will burn in the fire.  Bray welcomes everyone
   to the Era of Wyatt.

   Bray poses in the ring and John Cena's music plays.  John makes his way
   to the ring.

   John says there is a very energetic crowd tonight.  John says he
   introduces the new WWE Champion, Bray Wyatt.  John says he noticed that
   Bray has some supporters in the house tonight and he has brainwashed
   them.  John says they chanted 'You deserve it'.

   There are three words on his shirt.  No man deserves anything around
   here.  They earn every single inch they get.  You think you got the
   whole world in your hands?  The entire world is looking at that target
   around your shoulder.  Seeing as how we have a match tonight for that
   WWE Championship and everyone seems really excited about that, why not
   cut the chit chat and get to earning it right here, right now.

   AJ Styles' music plays and he says if John thinks he is getting his
   rematch first, John is wrong.  You think you can do everything because
   you are John Cena.  You can jump lines at the grocery store and
   airport.  Wait, you aren't normal like all of us.  AJ says this is
   about him.  This is about AJ Styles.  AJ says he beat John several
   times.  AJ says he knows he can beat Bray.  AJ wants his one-on-one
   rematch for the title right here, right now.

   Daniel Bryan's music plays and he makes his way to the stage.  Daniel
   congratulates Bray on winning the WWE Championship.  We seem to have a
   conundrum.  John Cena is owed a rematch.  AJ Styles is owed a rematch
   for the WWE Championship.  We have promised the people of Anaheim a WWE
   Championship match.

   Daniel says it will be John Cena versus AJ Styles versus Bray Wyatt in
   a Triple Threat Match.

   American Alpha walk in the back as we go to commercial.

   We are back and Dean Ambrose is looking for Baron Corbin as he walks
   through the back.

   Match Number One:  Chad Gable and Jason Jordan versus Konnor and Viktor
   in a Non Title Match

   Gable and Viktor start things off and Gable with a wrist lock and take
   down.  They lock up again and Viktor with a wrist lock.  Gable with a
   bridge and reversal into a leg trip and take down.  Viktor goes to talk
   to his partner.  Gable goes for an O'Connor Roll but Viktor holds on to
   the ropes.  Gable with a waist lock take down.  Viktor takes a shot at
   Jordan and all four men get into the ring and the Ascension send the
   champions to the floor but Gable and Jordan with clotheslines off the
   turnbuckles and The Ascension are sent to the floor.

   We go to commercial.

   We are back and Viktor with a reverse chin lock on Gable.  We see
   Viktor dropping Gable on the top rope after an eye rake.  Gable with
   punches but Viktor with a kick and an Irish whip that sends Gable
   sternum first into the turnbuckles.  Viktor with a near fall.  Konnor
   tags in and he sends Gable into the turnbuckles and Viktor with a knee.
    Konnor with a near fall.  Konnor with a reverse chin lock.

   Konnor with a forearm to the back.  Gable with an arm bar from the
   apron but Viktor tags in and keeps Gable from making the tag.  Jordan
   tags in and he connects with a clothesline and forearm to Konnor.
   Viktor is sent into the air.  Jordan with an overhead belly-to-belly
   suplex.  Jordan gets sent into the turnbuckles.  Konnor gets a near
   fall on Gable.  Gable and Jordan hit Grand Amplitude on Viktor for the
   three count.

   Winners:  Chad Gable and Jason Jordan

   After the match, the Usos appear on the TitanTron.  The Usos ask if
   American Alpha were celebrating after the Usos took them out.  Jey says
   it is not paranoia when the hairs stand up on the back of your necks.
   Jimmy says it's the Usos.

   James Ellsworth is in the back and he invites Carmella to dinner for
   Valentine's Day.

   Carmella says she thinks James is cute, but . . .

   Dean stops by and he wants to know where Corbin is.

   Dean tells James that Carmella is using him.

   Carmella asks James to deal with the gas station attendant.

   Daniel asks if there is a problem here.

   Dean asks to beat up James Ellsworth now.

   Daniel says that Dean has some anger issues after Sunday and Dean and
   James have issues so they have a match.

   James asks what just happened and Carmella says that he can teach that
   dirtbag a lesson.

   We go to commercial.

   We are back and James Ellsworth tells everyone to be quiet so he can
   introduce Carmella.

   Dean Ambrose's music plays for their match but he does not come out.

   Baron Corbin drags Dean Ambrose onto the stage and he kicks Dean as
   they go to the floor.  Ambrose with forearms and then Dean with a
   forearm off a storage case.  Corbin sends Ambrose onto an electrical
   board with Deep Six and it sends off sparks.

   We see what happened during Elimination Chamber when Natalya
   interrupted Nikki's interview and Maryse got a powder shower.

   Daniel Bryan tells Nikki this has to stop.

   Nikki says she has to defend herself.

   Daniel says he has an idea and Nikki will like it.

   Natalya shows up and brings up Nikki's boyfriend and the fact that
   Nikki is Daniel's sister in law.

   Nikki blames Natalya for the loss at Survivor Series.

   They argue over whose fault it is.

   They push each other and security comes in to try to pull them off each
   other.

   Daniel says next week, they will have a Falls Count Anywhere match next
   week.

   Daniel storms out of the office.

   We go to commercial.

   We are back with a Moments Ago Moment of Baron Corbin deciding to save
   James Ellsworth's life by attacking him in the back and near the stage.

   Baron Corbin walks in the back and he is asked about why he did what he
   did.

   Baron says people cannot be that stupid.  He is not WWE Champion
   because of Dean Ambrose.  Dean is on his way to the hospital because of
   Baron Corbin.

   Renee Young is with Dolph Ziggler in the back.  Renee asks Dolph about
   what he did after his match on Sunday.

   Dolph says he has been sore and he has been a loser, but the only sore
   losers are Kalisto and Crews, thank to him.  What Dolph did was send a
   message to the new generation.  Everyone thinks they are here to
   replace him, but they are not.  Dolph says he is just getting started
   and he has a long way to go.  If he has to eliminate an entire
   generation, he will do it.  No one steals the show like him and no one
   will steal his place.
