Pros and Cons of John Cena Defeating AJ Styles at WWE Royal Rumble 2017

   Credit: WWE.com
   [28]Ryan DilbertWWE Lead WriterJanuary 11, 2017

   At WWE Royal Rumble 2017, [29]John Cena will collide with AJ Styles
   with more than gold on the line. The WWE Championship match will
   affect WrestleMania positioning, the record books and the direction of
   the New Era.

   Cena is on the precipice of becoming a 16-time world champion. He's on
   the verge of earning another headline spot at WrestleMania.

   Should WWE lean on its longtime cornerstone again, or is it better to
   keep the crown atop Styles' head?

   Ahead of the Jan. 29 pay-per-view, WWE isn't faced with an easy
   decision. There are narrative and booking advantages to both potential
   results. The choice will come down to whether the company chooses the
   status quo over the surging, unsure future.


Pro: The Pursuit of History

   A story of a man chasing a legend awaits to be told.

   Hall of Famer Ric Flair has the most world title reigns in wrestling
   history with 16. Should Cena best Styles at the Rumble, he would match
   that mark.

     WWE Universe @WWEUniverse

     Chicago's @AllstateArena is ON THEIR FEET for the 15x World
     Champion, @JohnCena!!! #SDLive #WildCardFinals

   There is plenty of drama to harness from Cena drawing even and
   surpassing Flair.

   As we saw with The New Day's historic run with the tag team titles,
   closing in on history opens up compelling narrative avenues. It adds
   electricity to the present product. It invites comparison between
   present-day stars and the all-time greats.

   A Cena victory at the Rumble would allow WWE to trumpet a historic feat
   and drive home how special he is.


Con: Derailing a Shooting Star

   Since his arrival at last year's Rumble, there has been no one hotter
   in WWE than Styles. He rattled off instant classics, delivered strong
   promos and took the company by storm.

   It's a shame to put that rise on hold to make way for Cena's latest
   ascension.

   A Cena win at the January PPV would be more of the usual. To instead
   emphatically back Styles and let him conquer Cena once more would be a
   bold, intriguing move.

   Should WWE keep The Phenomenal One champion, his momentum will continue
   to grow. He will look more and more special as his title reign rolls
   on.

   If Styles is WWE champ after the Rumble, he will be assured a massive
   match at WrestleMania. Without the title, it's no guarantee he doesn't
   slide down the card.

   To lose to Cena now would almost feel like the big brother returning to
   claim his spot after the little brother ruled in his absence.


Pro: The Birth of a Dream Match

   Should Cena emerge from the Royal Rumble with WWE gold in hand, a
   marquee match for the ages would be halfway in place.

   The guys at Busted Open laid out a tantalizing scenario for the PPV:

     SiriusXM Busted Open @BustedOpenRadio

     "This certainly looks like Cena beats Styles, Taker wins the Rumble
     and Taker will try and get back the title at Mania 33" -
     #BustedOpenLive https://t.co/s2Icq1nppv
     [32]1/10/2017, 7:35:42 PM

   Cena vs. Undertaker at WrestleMania 33 would be huge without anything
   tangible on the line. If, however, it becomes a title vs. career match,
   the bout would soar into rare air.

   The champ and The Deadman for all the marbles is an obvious
   WrestleMania headline match. It will entice casual fans and stir up
   ample buzz. It will have a "match of the century" feel to it.

   Styles vs. someone else in that slot is not as safe a bet.

   But that's where WWE has to make a key decision. Will the company go
   the safest, surest route or take chances with an eye toward the future?


Con: A Move Away from the New Era

   Cena has been world champ more times than "Stone Cold" Steve Austin and
   Undertaker combined. He's headlined WrestleMania five times. His legacy
   is set.

   Before he ventures off to Hollywood for more long-term stretches, WWE
   would be smart to invest in fresh faces on the marquee.

     WWE Universe @WWEUniverse

     "@JohnCena has been GREAT for @WWE, but notice the two words in that
     sentence: HAS BEEN!" - @AJStylesOrg #SDLive #RoyalRumble
     https://t.co/9d05VgiPM4
     [33]1/4/2017, 2:02:53 AM

   A win at the Rumble all but assures Cena a spot in the climactic match
   at WrestleMania. That's a missed opportunity to elevate someone else
   and make a clear statement about WWE entering the much-ballyhooed New
   Era.

   Radio host Bill Matz suggested an alternative non-Cena headline bout:

     Bill Matz @BILLadelphia1

     Miz-Styles is my best case Mania main event. I hope Miz wins the
     Rumble.
     [34]1/11/2017, 4:03:18 AM

   That doesn't have the name power of Cena vs. Undertaker, but it would
   be a refreshing, eye-opening move. It would give Styles a shot at
   joining the same tier those men stand on. It would celebrate The Miz's
   recent surge and invest in two talents sure to stick around far longer
   than Cena and The Deadman.

   The WrestleMania event itself is what sells at this point, anyway. Fans
   buy up tickets before the card is even close to finalized.

   Sticking with Styles at the top would be a sign of change. It would tap
   into what's clicking and flourishing at the moment, moving away from an
   over-reliance on nostalgia.
