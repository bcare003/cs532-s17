   More on John Cena Taking Time Off WWE Following WrestleMania

      As we noted last night, John Cena is not being advertised for any WWE
      events following WrestleMania 33, and according to Dave Meltzer of
      Wrestling Observer Radio, Cena will indeed be taking another hiatus
      from the company.

      Cena’s time off will likely be to film the movie “The Pact”, which is
      scheduled to be released on April 20th, 2018.
