   Online retailer Amazon has announced plans to build an air cargo hub at
   the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport in Hebron, US, to support its
   growing fleet of aeroplanes.

   The [71]company expects to create more than 2,000 new jobs when the
   site opens.

   Building the hub will cost close to $1.5bn (£1.19bn).

   The move signals the company's continued expansion into transporting,
   sorting and delivering its own packages.

   Last year, Amazon entered into agreements to lease 40 dedicated Prime
   Air cargo planes.

   So far, 16 planes are in service for Amazon customers, with more
   rolling out over time.

   Amazon's site [72]currently lists in excess of 30 carriers that are
   used to transport packages, including delivery giants United Parcel
   Services and FedEx.

   By establishing its own cargo hub, the expectation is that Amazon will
   gradually take more control over the entire process of getting items to
   customers once ordered.

   Steve Banker, vice-president of supply chain services at consulting
   company ARC Advisory Group, said this is a sign of Amazon "ramping up"
   its business.

   "Amazon still loses money on deliveries, the IT service side of their
   business supports the retail operations. Owning the whole chain cuts
   out the middleman fees," said Mr Banker.

Economic boost

   The Governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin, said the plans for the cargo hub
   were "exciting".

   "Kentucky's ideal location, proven workforce and an already extensive
   shipping and logistics industry have been the backbone of our
   relationship with Amazon for nearly 20 years.

   "This new project will pay dividends to both the company and our state
   and we are truly grateful for the jobs and economic impact it will
   bring."

   The chief executive of the airport, Candace McGraw, called the hub
   "transformational" for the economy and businesses in the area.

   Last month, Amazon [73]said it will create 100,000 new, full-time jobs
   across the US by mid-2018 and also revealed plans to open new
   warehouses in [74]Texas,[75]Maryland and [76]Colorado.

   The company also [77]completed its first commercial drone delivery in
   the UK at the end of last year, with a package delivered to an address
   in Cambridge 13 minutes after being ordered.
