   The ever-trustworthy Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI securities is at it again with
   fresh iPhone 8 news, this time about a possible camera update.

   According to Kuo, [3]via 9to5Mac, Apple will incorporate a 3D sensing
   front-facing camera in the next iPhone. This would require the addition
   of an IR module and an improved front-facing camera.

   Not dissimilar to the Lumia 950 XL’s dual-sensor setup, the new camera
   would be able to capture a 3D image of the user, which will have
   multiple uses including biometric security and AR gaming.

   The innovation is the result of previous acquisitions PrimeSense, which
   will power the new tech, and, Lumentum’s IR technology. The [4]recent
   acquisition of Israeli startup, Realface, which specialises in facial
   recognition technology, also comes into clearer focus with today’s
   news.

   Apple gets a new trick

   The most interesting aspect of KGI’s report is the assertion that
   Android is “years” behind Apple in terms of 3D algorithms. The exact
   quote reads,

     “The analyst says Apple is years ahead of Android platform in terms
     of 3D algorithms which will make the advanced 3D camera sensor a
     unique iPhone feature for a couple of years.”

   If this report is accurate, and Apple is staking its individuality on
   3D algorithms, then it’s a smart direction to head in for two obvious
   reasons.

   Firstly, the AR market has had a huge injection in the last year thanks
   to Pokémon GO. Millions now know, understand and are comfortable with
   the AR concept and would be open to new innovations and
   smartphone-related features.

   If Apple is planning on heavily focusing on AR and 3D tech in the
   iPhone 8, then it couldn’t have picked a better time than now thanks to
   the Pokémon craze.

   Secondly, the reasons for buying an iPhone over an Android - or vice
   versa - are dwindling. All manufacturers need something to stand out.
   The operating systems are matched in features and design, whilst
   there’s little between the iPhone 7 and recent top Android handsets in
   performance and design.

   So a solid, genuinely innovative feature like fast and accurate
   biometric security facial recognition, or AR-inspired gaming, would
   certainly set the iPhone 8 against the competition.

   There are a few hurdles to clear, however, when it comes to facial
   recognition as a security feature. Namely inaccuracy and, as a result,
   speed. The Lumia 950XL suffered badly because of it, but I suspect
   Apple will have a better go of it, especially if the plan is to
   [5]replace Touch ID.

   Between [6]Samsung’s foldable phone and Apple’s new AR technology, 2017
   is shaping up to be a year of smartphone innovation. Something the
   industry has lacked in recent in recent times.
