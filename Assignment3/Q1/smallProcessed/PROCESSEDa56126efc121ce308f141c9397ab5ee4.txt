   Brock Lesnar vs. Dean Ambrose won't be WWE's WrestleMania 32 main
   event, but despite The Undertaker vs. Shane McMahon and Triple H vs.
   Roman Reigns also taking place on the show, it certainly should be.

   Yes, it's true that, despite what critics will say, Reigns vs. Triple H
   packs a star power punch, featuring one of the most accomplish WWE
   superstars of all-time and one of its top babyfaces. But Triple H vs.
   Reigns is a bout built on a long-running feud that WWE fans have hated
   from the start, a rivalry in which Triple H, the heel, finds himself
   being cheered while Reigns, the supposed babyface, is being booed so
   much it makes John Cena's lukewarm reactions pale in comparison.

   Likewise, The Undertaker vs. Shane McMahon isn't without its faults
   either. McMahon's return on Monday Night Raw and the resulting
   announcement of his Hell in a Cell match against The Undertaker came
   completely out of left field, and the match proves that the WWE is
   desperately attempting to give fans one more reason to tune into
   WrestleMania 32.

   While McMahon's involvement has people talking and is certainly quite
   the attraction, it's random, it's somewhat illogical and it forces the
   WWE to portray the legendary Undertaker as a heel while pairing him
   with Vince McMahon even though there is no real rhyme or reason behind
   it.

   Will Undertaker vs. Shane-O-Mac draw more fans to WrestleMania?
   Absolutely. is all abuzz about the match, and odds are that your
   typical WWE fan is, too.

     in a Cell?! Why is that a match I never knew I wanted to see until
     RIGHT NOW?!

   But that doesn't make it the show's main event. Whether the WWE
   realizes it or not, the real main event of WrestleMania 32 is Brock
   Lesnar vs. Dean Ambrose.

   That's because Lesnar vs. Ambrose has what Undertaker vs. McMahon and
   Reigns vs. Triple H don't have yet: True passion and genuine emotion.

   It's not believable that Triple H is trying to "hold down" Reigns when
   just about any hardcore WWE fan can tell you that the exact opposite is
   true, and in reality, Reigns is "Triple H's guy." Though it's very,
   very interesting, Undertaker vs. McMahon came completely out of the
   blue and doesn't have the gripping hook that the developing rivalry
   between Ambrose and Lesnar possesses.
