   Movie theaters across the United States will screen Michael Radford's
   adaptation of [45]George Orwell's dystopian classic, 1984, April 4th in
   protest of Donald Trump, [46]The Guardian reports.

   [47]Welcome to Donald Trump's Ignorant America

   Arts and humanities get at the truth of things – so naturally Trump's
   administration plans to defund them

   The event was organized by the [48]United States of Cinema and will
   include nearly 90 theaters in 79 cities in 34 states (plus one in
   Toronto). Radford's adaptation was released, fittingly, in 1984, and
   stars John Hurt as Winston Smith, a man who begins detailing life under
   an oppressive regime in an illegal diary. The April 4th event date is a
   nod to the date Smith begins his journal.

   "Orwell's portrait of a government that manufactures their own facts,
   demands total obedience and demonizes foreign enemies has never been
   timelier," the United States of Cinema said in a statement. "The
   endeavor encourages theaters to take a stand for our most basic values:
   freedom of speech, respect for our fellow human beings, and the simple
   truth that there are no such things as 'alternative facts.'"

   The statement also noted the Trump administration's plan to
   [49]potentially axe funding to the National Endowment for the Arts,
   writing that they "see any attempt to scuttle that program as an attack
   on free speech and creative expression through entertainment."

   Participating theaters will reportedly donate a portion of the proceeds
   to local charities, or use the money to underwrite future educational
   and community-related programing. A full list of participating theaters
   is available on the United States of Cinema website.

   Along with the organized screenings, Orwell's 1984 has seen a huge bump
   in relevance since Trump's election and inauguration. The week after he
   was sworn in, [50]1984 returned to the best-sellers list, while a
   theatrical adaptation is [51]scheduled to arrive on Broadway this June
   after successful runs in the U.K. and Los Angeles.
