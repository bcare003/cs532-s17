Alex Rodriguez Comments on Retirement, Says There's 'Zero' Chance of MLB
Return

   Despite making an appearance at spring training as a special adviser,
   former New York Yankees third baseman [29]Alex Rodriguez said there is
   "zero" chance he will return to the field as a player.

   “I haven’t had those thoughts,” Rodriguez [30]told reporters Tuesday.
   “I know that was kind of the general sense that I would probably come
   back and play, but being a Yankee means everything to me. I’m grateful
   to Hank and Hal Steinbrenner for the opportunity they gave me to rehab
   my life, to get my life back in order from the mistakes I made. So
   walking out with my mother and two daughters (in my final game at
   Yankee Stadium) is something I’ll never forget, and I think Hal and the
   New York fans for giving me that.”

   Rodriguez, 41, retired last August after being released by the Yankees
   to make room on the roster for young talent. He finished with 696
   career home runs and 2,086 runs batted in, both numbers that rank among
   the best in [31]MLB history but are shrouded in accusations of
   performance-enhancing drug use.

   After being released by the Yankees, Rodriguez said he had a "few
   offers" to return. The Miami Marlins, Rodriguez's hometown team, were
   [33]widely reported to have interest.

   "I thought about it for a minute," Rodriguez [34]told reporters. "I
   flew the whole family home after that Friday night. I thought about it
   a little bit that weekend. I was fortunate to have a few offers. I
   called them back and said, 'No thank you.'"

   Rodriguez will make $21 million this season, the final year of a $275
   million deal he signed in December 2007. The Yankees brought Rodriguez
   in as a special instructor for spring training as part of the agreement
   they made when releasing him last August. He is slated for six total
   days at the Yankees spring training facility.

   “I’m grateful for the opportunity to do what I’m doing now,” Rodriguez
   [35]said. “I’m kind of in a unique position here from all the things
   I’ve done in this game, both good and bad. I learned my biggest lessons
   from some my mistakes, and they were big ones. There’s so much that’s
   expected here in New York and it’s so difficult to play in New York. I
   think that—as staff and mentors—is the best thing we can do to get them
   ready for what’s expected of them there. Because it is a handful.”

   Rodriguez could see his role expand within the organization. Hal
   Steinbrenner [36]told reporters during his state of the Yankees address
   that he was "absolutely" interested in finding additional ways for
   Rodriguez to be involved. Steinbrenner went out of his way to
   compliment the former MVP's work with the Yankees' young roster.

   "I could spend all the time in the world on the field," Rodriguez
   [37]told reporters. "But these guys are great talents. They are the
   best players in high school and college. I think my value is taking
   them out to dinner and having a three-hour dinner. Recognizing that the
   first hour-and-a-half, they will probably pretty nervous and pretty
   tight. By the second half of that dinner, they will start asking real
   questions."
