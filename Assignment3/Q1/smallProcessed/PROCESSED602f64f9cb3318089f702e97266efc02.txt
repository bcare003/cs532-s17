'Dragon Ball Super' Spoilers: Apathetic Goku and Gohan's End Addressed; Fan
Theories Speculate on Protagonists' Character Development

   There are so much to be left explored in "Dragon Ball Super," and
   spoilers and fan theories are definitely helping avid viewers see what
   could be ahead for the show's main protagonists. Apart from the Future
   Trunks arc, some fans have noted Goku's alleged character regression
   and Gohan's character redemption.

   In a [18]Reddit forum, user SirTristanity mentioned that the Goku in
   "Dragon Ball Super" lacks the empathetic attitude the character has in
   other series. He then continued to argue that Goku could be easily
   replaced by Vegeta as the main protagonist for Super.

   "While Goku has always had a carefree attitude, this purely apathetic
   nature that he has developed was never obvious to viewers during the
   events of Dragon Ball Z," the user noted. "He has always given us the
   impression that even above his desire to fight strong opponents and
   pushing his limits, he places even higher value in the lives of his
   friends and innocent bystanders."

   "Fast forward to the most recent episode 52. Vegeta is recalling
   Trunks' description of what happened in the future and how Bulma was
   slaughtered by Black," the "Dragon Ball Super" fan added. "Black's
   attack on his family enrages Vegeta, prompting him to train intensely
   in the gravity room. Directly after this scene, Goku notes that 'Vegeta
   sure is pissed off.' At this point in time, I couldn't help but
   thinking to myself 'well...why aren't YOU pissed off?' Did he forget
   that Bulma is his oldest friend? That's Trunks is completely devastated
   by the destruction of his world? It's like all that concern for
   innocent lives and the well being of his friends completely disappeared
   with the beginning of Super."

   In a separate [19]Reddit thread, on the other hand, another fan made
   valid points for Gohan's character. Speculations have surfaced about
   the end of the Saiyan, and this "Dragon Ball Super" fan made
   interesting claims on why his character could still be great.

   "I have been ranting a lot about Gohan since last week when everyone
   decided that ep 52 would be the Death of Gohan as a character relevant
   to Super's plot," user Terez27 noted. "My strong feelings on this
   subject caught me kind of off-guard. I like Gohan, but he is far from
   my favorite character in DB, or even my favorite Saiyan. But all this
   pontificating about the End of Gohan strikes me as some Senbei
   sharkface level overreaction."

   "I think it's Piccolo's line that's really damning - if the guy who was
   training him is telling us and Trunks not to expect anything of him,
   what makes us think that's not the case?" User mozillavulpix replied.
   "Ep 52 was just so blatant in telling people to get over the [20]idea
   of Gohan fighting. You could say it was almost a little too blatant,
   but I can't imagine Toei purposely making an episode just for a red
   herring. They've never done that before."

   What do you think of these "Dragon Ball Super" spoilers and
   observations? Do you agree? Sound off below!
