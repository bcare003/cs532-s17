   USA TODAY Sports' Lindsay Jones breaks down how the Patriots managed to
   pull off a comeback for the ages in Super Bowl LI. USA TODAY Sports

   In addition to setting numerous records, the New England Patriots'
   Super Bowl LI victory Sunday put a final pin in Deflategate.(Photo:

   HOUSTON — Finally, officially, completely and certainly, Deflategate is
   over.

   It ended Sunday night at 9:30 local time at NRG Stadium, when New
   England running back James White scored his third touchdown, a 2-yard
   run four minutes into overtime, to end Super Bowl LI with a 34-28
   Patriots’ victory.

   It ended when Tom Brady, the man who served a four-game suspension at
   the start of this season for tampering with the air pressure in his
   footballs more than two years ago, won his fifth Super Bowl, the most
   of any quarterback in history.

   It ended with the sterling performance that earned Brady his
   unprecedented fourth Super Bowl MVP award. It was over when the
   Patriots completed an historic comeback from a 25-point deficit.
   It ended with that clutch Super Bowl-winning drive, just another
   in Brady's collection of clutch Super Bowl winning drives.

   Robert Kraft takes shot at Roger Goodell after 'sweetest' Super Bowl
   win

   Tom Brady stands alone as NFL's greatest after rescuing Patriots in
   Super Bowl
   [78]

   Patriots deserved Julian Edelman's spectacular catch

   You want to bring up Deflategate now? Go ahead and try, but you’re on
   your own. The NFL has been checking the pressure in its footballs more
   carefully the past two years, and all Brady has done is win two of the
   last three Super Bowls.

   “Two years ago, we won our fourth Super Bowl down in Arizona and I told
   our fans that was the sweetest one of all,” Patriots owner Robert Kraft
   said to the crowd after the game. “But a lot has transpired during the
   last two years, and I don’t think that needs any explanation.”

   I don’t either. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell was booed loudly by
   Patriots fans for the entirety of his statement to Kraft as he handed
   him the Lombardi Trophy, proving Deflategate might be over, but it
   certainly has not been forgotten in Boston.

   Actually, it’s time for New England fans to let it go. You won. Declare
   victory. Move on.

   Whether you think Brady was a cheater, or you’re still angry that he
   was viewed (and punished) as the culprit, Deflategate is a footnote
   now. It just doesn’t stand a chance against the totality of Brady’s
   scintillating record.

   Consider this: the 39-year-old has now completed 207 out of 309 passes
   for 2,071 yards and 15 touchdowns with five interceptions in all of his
   Super Bowl appearances. No other quarterback in history has more than
   1,200 yards passing in Super Bowl play, and Brady’s 207 completions are
   more than twice as many as any other quarterback in Super Bowl history.

   Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback in NFL history, Deflategate or no
   Deflategate.

   “You just saw that for yourself,” said New England safety Patrick
   Chung. “He brought us down and he brought us another Super Bowl, so
   whoever says that he is not the greatest, you guys are stupid.”

   We are not stupid.

   “He is the Michael Jordan of football,” said Patriots safety Duron
   Harmon. “The greatest of all-time is Tom Brady.”

   Other people who don’t play on his team agreed.

   A sampling from Twitter:

   Justin Timberlake: “Tom. Brady. G.O.A.T.”

   Kobe Bryant: “5 rings can’t be deflated.”

     5 rings can't be deflated [79]#Brady[80]#Muse
     — Kobe Bryant (@kobebryant) [81]February 6, 2017

   LeBron James: “Brady=GOAT. CONGRATS brother!!”

   Tom Glavine: Congrats to my Pats…great season Falcons…suck it Goodell.”

   See what I mean about it being time for New Englanders to let it go?

   Brady has. He was asked a couple of times after the game about the
   “struggles” the franchise has endured. He wasn’t biting.

   “There was a lot at stake tonight,” he said. “You know, we played our
   tails off all season to get to this point and it’s hard to win a game
   in the NFL. And to beat this team and to get down, 28-3, it was just a
   lot of mental toughness by our team and we’re all going to remember
   this for the rest of our lives.”

   A reporter tried one more time.

   “We’ve done pretty good over the last few years, you know?” Brady said.
   “We were in the AFC Championship last year and won the Super Bowl two
   years ago, so I don’t think anyone’s feeling bad for the Patriots.”

   And just like that, the last embers of Deflategate went dark.
