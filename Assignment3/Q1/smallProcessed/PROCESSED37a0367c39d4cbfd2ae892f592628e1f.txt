Black Conspiracy Theory 101: Did Chick-fil-A’s President Say ‘We Don’t Like
Blacks Either’?

   Written By [41]Ruth Manuel-Logan

   In June 2012, fast-food chain Chick-fil-A was placed in an extremely
   unfavorable light following a series of public comments made by its
   chief operating officer and son of the company’s founder, Dan Cathy,
   who vehemently [43]opposed same-sex marriage. Gay civil rights
   activists called for a protest of the chicken eatery, while staunch
   anti-gay-rights supporters stood behind the company, boosting
   Chick-fil-A’s sales. In August 2012, the company’s sales went through
   the roof, after its supporters staged a “Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day.
   Not long after the incredible sales boon, the [44]Free Wood Press
   published an article stating that, according to a senior level manager,
   Cathy had concocted a controversial marketing ploy that involved Blacks
   because “bigotry and hatred are extremely profitable” in this country —
   which just like his anti-gay stance — would also increase the company’s
   bottom line. But is it true?

   Call For Hurricanes To Be Named Blacks?

   Since Chick-fil-A has a strong Southern customer base, Cathy reportedly
   saw dollar signs with his anti-Blacks stance, and according to the Free
   Wood Press, he stated the following:

     Let’s milk this for all its worth. Let’s wait until this gay thing
     dies down a little, then I will release another statement that says
     that we don’t like Blacks either. Now, they’re protected by those
     stupid discrimination laws so we’ll need to be careful, but I think
     it will work. I mean, hey, it’s not like it’s a lie. We’ll have
     another Chick-Fil-A Appreciation Day before you know it!

   The article then went further by alleging that they had confronted
   Cathy and he had this to say:

     We are a private company with a deeply personal belief system. We
     are lucky to live in a country where we are allowed to practice
     those beliefs. We abide by all of the discrimination laws and we
     welcome colored folk in our restaurants. I even hire them to work in
     my restaurants. We do not discriminate against anyone because of
     their color. However, if I’m being honest, we really don’t care for
     them. That is my opinion and I have a right to express it.

     December 30, 2005

   The news outlet then alleged that Cathy had even baser aspirations in
   the near future: down the line, Cathy planned to focus on “liberals and
   people of Asian, Hispanic and Arabic descent.”

   According to the paper, since there is a lot of hate in the U.S.A.,
   Cathy planned to “milk” every last drop.”

   Not surprisingly, the alleged Cathy racial bias crusade against Blacks
   and other minorities spread like wildfire via the media: Those who came
   across the scandalous news about Cathy’s alleged latest marketing
   scheme were left seething, due to the likelihood  that southern racists
   would back his company’s biases all the way.

   But Cathy never made such incendiary comments about Blacks or any other
   minority group, because the alleged news report was, in fact,  just a
   bad joke.

   In fact, the news outlet is a political satire web publication that
   does, on occasion, use actual names in partially real or mostly
   fictitious ways, stating that “all news articles contained within
   FreeWoodPost.com are fiction, and presumably fake news.”
