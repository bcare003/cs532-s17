   DALLAS -- After years of being fodder for Charles Barkley to comment on
   in his role as an analyst on TNT's "Inside the NBA," [100]LeBron James
   has heard enough.

   "He's a hater," James told ESPN of Barkley following the [101]Cleveland
   Cavaliers' [102]104-97 loss to the [103]Dallas Mavericks on Monday.
   "What makes what he says credible? Because he's on TV?"

   James had been stewing the past couple of days after Barkley took James
   to task for the four-time MVP calling out the Cavs for needing to
   fortify the roster with another playmaker to have a realistic shot at a
   repeat title.

   "Inappropriate. Whiny. All of the above," Barkley said of James last
   week. "The Cleveland Cavaliers, they have given him everything he
   wanted. They have the highest payroll in NBA history. He wanted
   [104]J.R. Smith last summer, they paid him. He wanted [[105]Iman]
   Shumpert last summer. They brought in [106]Kyle Korver. He's the best
   player in the world. Does he want all of the good players? He don't
   want to compete? He is an amazing player. They're the defending
   champs."

   Barkley has consistently needled James, telling HBO's Bill Simmons over
   the summer that James would "never" ascend to top-five status in NBA
   history over Michael Jordan, Oscar Robertson, Bill Russell, Kareem
   Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain, and going back all the way to 2010
   and James' "The Decision" television special, when Barkley told ESPN
   Radio 103.3 FM in Dallas/Fort Worth that it was a "punk move" for James
   to leave the Cavs to take up with the [113]Miami Heat.

   James initially took the high road when asked about Barkley's recent
   comments, saying they were "good for the ratings," while defending his
   competitive spirit.

   But after ESPN followed up with a story asking [114]Tristan Thompson
   for his thoughts on Barkley's comments, James chose to speak out again
   in ardent fashion.

   "I'm not going to let him disrespect my legacy like that," James told
   ESPN. "I'm not the one who threw somebody through a window. I never
   spit on a kid. I never had unpaid debt in Las Vegas. I never said, 'I'm
   not a role model.' I never showed up to All-Star Weekend on Sunday
   because I was in Vegas all weekend partying.

   "All I've done for my entire career is represent the NBA the right way.
   Fourteen years, never got in trouble. Respected the game. Print that."

   James, whose friendships with [115]Dwyane Wade, [116]Chris Paul and
   [117]Carmelo Anthony have also been called into question, recalled
   watching a 1993 NBA Finals game between Jordan's [118]Chicago Bulls and
   Barkley's [119]Phoenix Suns and being surprised what he saw on his
   screen.

   "Go watch the '93 Finals when John Paxson hit the shot," James said.
   "Barkley and Jordan were laughing and joking with each other during one
   of the games while somebody's shooting a free throw. In the Finals.
   But, oh, nobody were friends back then."

   Bringing up Anthony reminded James of another basketball luminary who
   has tweaked him this season -- [120]New York Knicks president Phil
   Jackson -- and he had a story to share about Jackson as well.

   "I went to see Melo at the Garden two years ago when we were in New
   York," James said. "They played [121]Portland. I went up to a suite at
   halftime, and Phil Jackson didn't say one word to me."

   This fall, Jackson brought up James unprompted in an interview with
   ESPN's Jackie MacMullan and described James and his close circle of
   business associates -- Rich Paul, Maverick Carter and Randy Mims -- as
   his "posse."

   "I'm here to win ballgames and take care of my teammates and take care
   of my, what's that word, oh, my 'posse,'" James said, animatedly.

   He had more words for Barkley too.

   "I know he wanted to retire a long time ago, but he can't," James said.
   "He's stuck up on that stage every week."

   James then issued a challenge, of sorts.

   "And if this makes him want to talk to me, the schedule's out there,"
   James said. "He knows every road arena I'll be in. Don't just come up
   to me at All-Star and shake my hand and smile."

   It was James' second bout of frustration shared with the media in a
   week, as the Cavs finished out January going 7-8. It was the first time
   James has had a losing record in a calendar month with at least 10
   games played since February 2006 -- his third season in the NBA -- when
   the Cavaliers went 6-8, according to ESPN Stats & Information.

   James also spoke up about the perception he and his inner circle face
   as young, successful black businessmen, believing that identity being
   so rare in the power structure of professional sports makes him and his
   partners targets.

   "I collect one paycheck from this," James said of his role with the
   Cavs. "There's the owner, Griff's [David Griffin] the GM, I'm the
   player. Screw Charles Barkley."

   James put on his baseball cap and offered a parting thought as he
   prepared to leave the visitors locker room at the American Airlines
   Center to head to the airport for a flight back to Cleveland.

   "I'm tired of biting my tongue," James said. "There's a new sheriff in
   town."

   [122]Chicago Bulls shooting guard [123]Dwyane Wade, who played with
   James on the [124]Miami Heat, said Tuesday, "Thank God [James] finally
   said something. LeBron, a lot of guys take a lot of shots at him, for
   whatever reason. He's always been [a focal point like], all of the
   great players in the game. He just has kept his mouth closed, continued
   to focus on what he need to. But it's about time he said something.

   "Sometimes when guys get on a microphone in front of their face they
   just talk and talk and talk and forget about their history. We all make
   that mistake, but especially that guy on TV. He acts like he just
   walked on water. I like the fact that Bron called him out ... He said
   there's a new sheriff in town so I'm excited to see what's next."
