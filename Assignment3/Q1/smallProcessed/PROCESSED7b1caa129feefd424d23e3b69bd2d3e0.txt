The Tragedy of Sarah Palin

   From the moment Sarah Palin’s acceptance speech electrified the
   Republican convention, she was seen as an unbending, hard-charging,
   red-meat ideologue—to which soon was added “thin-skinned” and
   “vindictive.” But a look at what Palin did while in office in
   Alaska—the only record she has—shows a very different politician: one
   who worked with Democrats to tame Big Oil and solve the great problem
   at the heart of the state’s politics. That Sarah Palin might have set
   the nation on a different course. What went wrong?

   It’s hard to escape Sarah Palin. On Facebook and Twitter, cable news
   and reality television, she is a constant object of dispute, the target
   or instigator of some distressingly large proportion of the political
   discourse. If she runs for president—well, brace yourself! But there is
   one place where a kind of collective resolve has been able to push her
   aside, make her a less suffocating presence than almost everywhere
   else: Alaska.

   During a week spent traveling there recently, I learned that Palin
   occupies a place in the minds of most Alaskans roughly like that of an
   ex-spouse from a stormy marriage: she’s a distant bad memory, and
   questions about her seem vaguely unwelcome. Visitors to Juneau, the
   capital and a haven for cruise-ship tourism, are hard-pressed to find
   signs of the state’s most famous citizen—no “Mama Grizzly” memorabilia
   or T-shirts bearing her spunky slogans. Although the town was buzzing
   with politics because the legislature was in session, talk of Palin
   mainly revolved around a rumored Democratic poll showing her to be less
   popular in Alaska right now than Barack Obama. The only tangible
   evidence I saw was her official portrait in the capitol and a small
   sign in the window of a seedy-looking gift shop advertising “Sarah
   Palin toilet paper.” Alaska has moved on.

   So has Palin. Two years after abruptly resigning the governorship, she
   is a national figure, touring the country to promote her books;
   speaking out whenever moved to on important issues of the day; and
   serving, mainly through Fox News, as the guardian-enforcer of a
   particularly martial brand of conservatism. Though she still lives in
   Alaska, she has all but withdrawn from its public life, appearing only
   seldom and then usually to film her reality-television show, Sarah
   Palin’s Alaska.

   But if she decides to run for the White House—and she’ll have to make
   up her mind soon—all of that will change. As much as Alaska might like
   to forget Sarah Palin, and she it, her record there, especially as
   governor, will take on new salience.

   Palin entered the national consciousness more suddenly than most
   high-level politicians do, and she did it in the intense final stretch
   of a presidential campaign, which had a kiln-like effect of hardening
   the initial impression—depending on your point of view, of the
   provincial half-wit portrayed by Tina Fey or the plain-sense Mama
   Grizzly proudly leading her army of culture warriors. In modern
   politics, your “brand,” once established, is almost impossible to
   change. Only a handful of politicians have changed theirs (Hillary
   Clinton is one), and then only through tireless perseverance. Palin has
   shown little inclination to revise or deepen these impressions—she
   didn’t respond to my requests to discuss her record—and she hasn’t
   designated anyone else to do it for her. (Mama Grizzlies claw; they
   don’t contextualize.)

   But over the past few months, Palin has begun fortifying her profile by
   visiting foreign countries and delivering speeches that extol her
   record as governor, especially on energy, as she did in March to an
   audience of international business leaders in India. Energy was
   supposed to be her big issue in the 2008 presidential campaign, but it
   was overshadowed by her missteps. She seems to be reintroducing
   herself.

   And there’s plenty she could reintroduce—much more than the public,
   which long ago made up its mind about Palin, has any idea she actually
   achieved. For all the attention she gets, her claim to a role in public
   life is rarely the focus; more often, it’s dismissed outright. In any
   discussion of her candidacy, her critics’ first argument for why she
   couldn’t win, always slapped down like a winning poker hand, is that
   she quit her governorship. That’s indeed discreditable and harms her
   chances, but it glides right past the question of what she did before
   she quit, and how that has turned out for Alaska. And that’s a more
   interesting story than you might suppose—a story quite at odds with her
   popular perception today in Alaska and everywhere else.

   As governor, Palin demonstrated many of the qualities we expect in our
   best leaders. She set aside private concerns for the greater good,
   forgoing a focus on social issues to confront the great problem
   plaguing Alaska, its corrupt oil-and-gas politics. She did this in a
   way that seems wildly out of character today—by cooperating with
   Democrats and moderate Republicans to raise taxes on Big Business. And
   she succeeded to a remarkable extent in settling, at least for a time,
   what had seemed insoluble problems, in the process putting Alaska on a
   trajectory to financial well-being. Since 2008, Sarah Palin has
   influenced her party, and the tenor of its politics, perhaps more than
   any other Republican, but in a way that is almost the antithesis of
   what she did in Alaska. Had she stayed true to her record, she might
   have pointed her party in a very different direction.

   Inside the Alaska capitol hangs a framed copy of the front page of the
   Anchorage Daily News for September 11, 1969, its headline—“Alaska’s
   Richest Day: $900 Million!”—stretching above a picture of
   purposeful-looking men in suits carrying large briefcases and about to
   duck into a car. The briefcases contain a fortune that is being rushed
   to the airport and on to a bank in San Francisco, so Alaskans will not
   forgo a single day’s interest. This is the proceeds of the state’s
   first oil-lease auction since the discovery, a year earlier, of the
   massive oil deposit at Prudhoe Bay on Alaska’s North Slope, to this day
   the largest in North America. The headline captures the euphoria over
   the massive payout by the world’s leading oil companies—a windfall that
   transformed the state’s politics, economy, and self-image almost
   overnight.

   Throughout most of its history as a territory and, after 1959, as a
   state, Alaska was a tenuous proposition, a barren outpost rich in
   resources yet congenitally poor because the outside interests that
   extracted them didn’t leave much behind. The main obstacle to statehood
   was convincing Congress that Alaska wouldn’t immediately go bust. It
   still relies heavily on aid from Washington, and that, combined with
   the federal government’s holding title to 60 percent of its land base
   (the state itself holds 28 percent more), generates a robust resentment
   of federal power. The colonial mind-set is reinforced by the intensity
   of the state’s politics, a common attribute of remote settlements like
   Alaska, as the historian Ken Coates has noted—think Lord of the Flies.

   To suddenly strike it rich opens up all sorts of possibilities, but
   there can be problems too. The legislature exhausted its fortune
   without meeting Alaskans’ outsize expectations. And although oil
   brought jobs and revenue, it also ensured that a state long accustomed
   to economic subservience would be beholden to a powerful new interest.
   Oil is more important to Alaska than the movie business is to Los
   Angeles or the auto industry is to Michigan. Stephen Haycox, a
   professor at the University of Alaska at Anchorage, writes in
   [68]Frigid Embrace, his history of the state’s political economy, “The
   oil industry is, for all practical purposes, Alaska’s only private
   economy.”

   This binds the state’s fortunes not just to the price of oil but also
   to the fate of the three giants that dominate Alaska: BP, ExxonMobil,
   and ConocoPhillips. Oil taxes supply almost 90 percent of the general
   revenue, so oil is the central arena of state politics. The industry is
   forever trying to coax lower taxes, lighter regulation, and greater
   public investment by promising jobs and riches—or, on occasion,
   threatening to withdraw them.

   In 1978, the Democratic legislature tried to secure the state’s share
   of oil profits by establishing a corporate income tax over the bitter
   opposition of the oil companies, which sued to overturn it. They lost
   in every venue, including, finally, the U.S. Supreme Court. But the
   real battle was fought in the statehouse.

   The oil industry contributed mainly to Republicans through the 1960s
   and ’70s, but came to realize that it needed broader alliances, and in
   the late ’70s began courting Democrats too. The strategy paid off. In
   1981, the oil companies, through their allies in the legislature,
   launched a coup, ousting the speaker of the house and key committee
   chairmen. Then they revoked the corporate income tax. For the next 25
   years, oil interests ruled the state almost uninterruptedly.

   Palin’s rise began in 2002, when, term-limited as mayor of Wasilla, she
   ran for lieutenant governor. Little known and heavily outspent, she
   beat expectations, losing only narrowly and showing an exceptional
   ability to win fervent support. Afterward, she campaigned for Frank
   Murkowski, the four-term Alaska senator come home to run for governor.
   Palin traveled the state speaking about Murkowski, and making herself
   better known. When he won, she was short-listed to serve the remainder
   of his Senate term, and even interviewed for the job. But it went to
   his daughter Lisa instead. (Palin acidly recounts the patronizing
   interview with the new governor in her memoir, Going Rogue.) Palin got
   the low-profile chairmanship of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation
   Commission, a regulatory body charged with ensuring that these
   resources are developed in the public interest.

   By the time she arrived, the notion that Alaska’s oil-and-gas policy
   operated in the public interest was getting hard to maintain. The
   industry controlled the state, and especially the Republican Party.
   Other than a modest adjustment to oil taxes that squeezed through in
   1989 after the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the hammerlock held. Alaskans
   were coming to regard this situation with suspicion and anxiety. The
   problem wasn’t just that the state was starved of revenue from its most
   valuable resource. It was also the failure to develop another resource
   to which the oil companies held title: Alaska’s bountiful supply of
   natural gas. It’s always been understood that North Slope oil would one
   day run dry. Someday, perhaps as soon as 2019, there won’t be enough
   oil left to push through the trans-Alaska pipeline—a catastrophe,
   unless the state somehow replaces the revenue. For this reason,
   building a gas pipeline has long been a political priority, and one the
   oil companies have balked at.

   From her spot on the oil-and-gas commission, Palin touched off a storm
   over these anxieties. One glaring example of the unhealthy commingling
   of oil interests and Republican politics was her fellow commissioner
   and Murkowski appointee, Randy Ruedrich, who was also chairman of the
   state Republican Party. Less than a year into the job, Ruedrich got
   crosswise with Palin for conducting party business from his office
   (and, it was later revealed, giving information to a company that the
   commission oversaw). When he ignored her admonitions to stop, she
   complained to Murkowski’s staff, but still nothing happened. So Palin
   laid out her concerns in a letter to the governor and the story leaked
   to the media. In the ensuing uproar, Palin became a hero and Murkowski
   was left no choice but to fire Ruedrich from the commission.

   Palin got strong support from an unlikely quarter: Democrats. “She had
   the appearance of someone who was willing to go in a different
   direction,” Hollis French, a Democratic state senator, told me. “We
   subsequently learned that she’ll throw anyone under a bus, but that
   wasn’t apparent at the time. It looked like real moral courage.”

   Even so, Palin’s actions were presumed to have ruined her prospects.
   Murkowski and Ruedrich still ran the party. Breaking with them made her
   no longer viable as an ordinary Republican or a recipient of
   oil-company largesse. To continue her rise, she needed to find another
   path. Palin alone imagined that she could. In this and other ways, she
   displayed all the traits that would become famous: the intense
   personalization of politics, the hyper-aggressive score-settling—and
   the dramatic public gesture, which came next.

   Palin was clearly the victor (Ruedrich paid the largest civil fine in
   state history), but she quit the commission anyway. In Going Rogue, she
   says only that as a commissioner, she was subject to a gag order that
   Murkowski refused to lift. But quitting didn’t void the gag order. What
   it did was thrust her back into the spotlight and reinforce her public
   image. It also gave her a rationale to challenge Murkowski.

   All of this turned out to be shrewd politics, because Murkowski’s
   governorship proceeded to fall apart, thanks to his brazen sense of
   entitlement. After failing to persuade the Homeland Security Department
   to buy him a personal jet (to help “defend, deter or defeat opposition
   forces”), he ignored the legislature’s objections and bought one with
   state funds. But it was his handling of matters vital to the state’s
   future that finally threw open the door for Palin.

   Murkowski made up his mind to strike a deal with the major oil
   producers to finally build a gas pipeline from the North Slope. He cut
   out the legislature and insisted on negotiating through his own team of
   experts, out of public sight. This rankled all sorts of people because,
   beyond his arrogance, Murkowski had distinct views about oil and gas
   that many others didn’t share.

   Alaska’s parties align differently from parties elsewhere—they’re
   further to the right and principally concerned with resource
   extraction. The major philosophical divide, especially on oil and gas,
   is between those who view the state as beholden to the oil companies
   for its livelihood, and will grant them almost anything to ensure that
   livelihood, and those who view its position as being like the owner of
   a public corporation for whom the oil companies’ interests are separate
   from and subordinate to those of its citizen-shareholders. “Oil and gas
   cuts a swath right through ordinary partisan politics,” Patrick Galvin,
   Palin’s revenue commissioner, told me.

   Murkowski’s willingness to cater to the oil producers, and his secrecy,
   caused tensions in his administration that burst into view when he
   announced his deal, in October 2005. It was a breathtaking giveaway
   that ceded control of the pipeline to the oil companies and retained
   only a small stake for Alaskans; established a 30-year regime of low
   taxes impossible to revoke; indemnified companies against any damages
   from accidents; and exempted everything from open-records laws. In
   exchange, the state got an increase in the oil-production tax. (Palin
   later released a private memo in which Murkowski’s top economic adviser
   complains that he has “gone completely overboard” and is treating
   “Alaska as a banana republic in order to secure the gas line.”) The
   deal conceded so much that Murkowski’s natural-resources commissioner,
   Tom Irwin, publicly questioned its legality—and was summarily fired.
   Six of Irwin’s aides quit in protest, and the “Magnificent Seven”
   became a cause célèbre. In the end, the legislature rejected the
   gas-line deal. But, in a twist, it agreed to the oil tax—which had been
   intended as an inducement to pass the rest of the package.

   Palin came out hard on the other side of the philosophical divide from
   Murkowski—and made it personal. She announced she would challenge him
   for governor. She assailed the “secret gas line deal” and the
   “multinational oil companies that make mind-boggling profits off
   resources owned by all Alaskans.” She put an “all-Alaska” pipeline at
   the center of her campaign. And she declared her intention to hire Tom
   Irwin to negotiate the deal. “She’s what I call ‘alley-cat smart,’”
   Tony Knowles, the former Democratic governor, told me. “It’s not about
   ideology. She knows how to pick her way down the political route that
   she feels will be the most beneficial to what she wants to do.”

   Murkowski’s tax was discredited almost immediately. Just after he
   signed the new Petroleum Profits Tax, the FBI raided the offices of six
   legislators, in what became the biggest corruption scandal in state
   history. During the legislative session, the FBI had hidden a video
   camera at the Baranof Hotel, in Juneau, in a suite that belonged to
   Bill Allen, a major power broker and the chief executive of Veco
   Corporation, an oil-services firm. The tapes showed him discussing
   bribes with important politicians, and revealed the existence of a
   group of Republican legislators who called themselves the “Corrupt
   Bastards Club” and took bribes from Allen and others. (Several were
   later sent to prison.)

   In the Republican primary, Palin crushed Murkowski, delivering one of
   the worst defeats ever suffered by an incumbent governor anywhere. She
   went on to have little trouble dispatching Knowles, an oil-friendly
   Democrat. “A lot of people on the East Coast, when they think of Sarah
   Palin now,” Cliff Groh, a former state tax lobbyist, told me, “some
   five-letter words come to mind: Scary. Crazy. Angry. Maybe some others.
   But the five-letter word that people in Alaska associated with her name
   was clean.”

   Palin has gained a reputation for being erratic, undisciplined, not up
   to the job. But that wasn’t how she looked as governor. She began by
   confronting the two biggest issues in Alaska—the gas pipeline and the
   oil tax—and drove the policy process on both of them.

   After taking office in December 2006, she kept her word and hired Tom
   Irwin, and other members of the Magnificent Seven. They devised a plan
   to attract someone other than the oil companies to build the pipeline,
   and they bid out the license to move ahead with it—to the deep
   displeasure of the oil producers, who vowed not to participate. Palin
   came under serious political pressure. Although she doesn’t mention it
   in Going Rogue, the Associated Press discovered that Vice President
   Dick Cheney called her at least twice that month. According to her
   aides, Cheney urged her to make concessions, but she didn’t.

   That spring, the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act sailed to passage,
   helped along by criminal indictments in the Veco scandal, which were
   handed down just as the bill came up. Still, Palin was the deciding
   factor. A new pipeline plan had seemed unlikely when she took over, but
   she kept the legislature focused on the task.

   She kept herself focused, too: though priding herself on her
   well-advertised social conservatism, she was prepared to set it aside
   when necessary. Rather than pick big fights about social issues, she
   declined to take up two abortion-restriction measures that she favored,
   and vetoed a bill banning benefits for same-sex partners of state
   workers.

   Next came the oil tax. The corruption scandal had tainted Murkowski’s
   new law. The FBI tapes of Bill Allen revealed that it was central to
   the bribery. “It became clear,” Hollis French told me, “that filthy,
   filthy things had happened to influence that tax.” Most Alaskans were
   disgusted and open to revisiting, and possibly increasing, the tax. But
   Palin’s preferred mode of operating—charging righteously forth to
   attack her enemies—would make a new agreement harder, not easier, to
   reach. An explicit charge that the Petroleum Profits Tax was corrupt
   would imply, by extension, that the (unindicted) legislators who had
   passed it were corrupt, too—and she needed their votes.

   Again Palin kept her worst impulses in check. And when she was drawn
   into the fight, she proved nimble and resourceful. Two things finally
   prompted her to move ahead: when tax season rolled around, the PPT
   yielded much less revenue than anticipated; and Democrats needled her
   incessantly about how much of a reformer she truly was. Then as now
   twitchingly alert to any slight, Palin loathed the implication.

   In September, she released her proposal and, so no one missed the
   point, christened it Alaska’s Clear and Equitable Share (ACES).
   Stronger than Murkowski’s PPT, it met a mostly hostile reception from
   her party. “I will stand in your way like the little man in Tiananmen
   Square to keep you from hurting the economy,” one Republican House
   member declared. Democrats, eager to capitalize on public anger,
   introduced several tougher alternatives that were particularly
   aggressive—that is, confiscatory—when oil prices rose. Palin focused on
   capturing more revenue when prices were low.

   At first, her team tried to win the Republicans over. But it became
   clear this wasn’t going to happen. So Palin did something that would be
   hard to imagine from her today: she pivoted to the Democrats. “We sat
   down with her and said, ‘If you want to get something passed, it’ll
   have to be much stronger,’” Les Gara, a liberal House member, told me.
   “And to give her credit, she did what she needed to get a bill passed.”

   In the end, Palin essentially grafted the Democrats’ proposal onto her
   own. What she signed into law went well beyond her original proposal:
   ACES imposes a higher base tax rate than its predecessor on oil
   profits. But the really significant part has been that the tax rate
   rises much sooner and more steeply as oil prices climb—the part
   Democrats pushed for. The tax is assessed monthly, rather than
   annually, to better capture price spikes, of which there have been
   many. ACES also makes it harder for companies to claim tax credits for
   cleaning up spills caused by their own negligence, as some had done
   under the old regime.

   Four years later, Palin’s gas line hasn’t gotten going, but it’s not
   really her fault. Plunging natural-gas prices have made the project
   uneconomical. Her oil tax is a different story: though designed to
   capture more revenue under most scenarios, ACES has raised a lot more
   money than almost anyone imagined. That’s largely because of high oil
   prices. But it also shows that the law is working. ConocoPhillips, BP,
   and ExxonMobil have reported record profits—so it’s fitting that, in a
   sense, Alaska has, too. It’s no exaggeration to say that ACES has made
   the state one of the fiscally strongest in the union. Flush with cash,
   Alaska produced large capital budgets that blunted the effects of the
   recession. Moody’s just upped the state’s bond rating to AAA for the
   first time. While other states reel under staggering deficits, budget
   cuts, and protests, Alaska has built up a $12 billion surplus, most of
   it attributable to Palin’s tax. Galvin estimates that it has raised $8
   billion more than Murkowski’s tax would have. But given the corruption
   that plagued the PPT, a better benchmark might be the tax it
   supplanted—the one put on the books after the Exxon Valdez spill. By
   that measure, Palin’s major achievement has probably meant the
   difference between a $12 billion surplus and a deficit.

   What happened to Sarah Palin? How did someone who so effectively dealt
   with the two great issues vexing Alaska fall from grace so quickly?
   Anyone looking back at her record can’t help but wonder: How did a
   popular, reformist governor beloved by Democrats come to embody
   right-wing resentment?

   A big part of the answer is that the qualities that brought her
   original successes—the relentlessness, the impulse to settle
   scores—weren’t nearly so admirable when deployed against less worthy
   foes than Murkowski and the oil companies. In Alaska, she applied those
   qualities to fulfilling the promises that got her elected, and in her
   first year was the most popular governor in the country. “It was very,
   very powerful stuff,” Anita Dunn, a Democratic strategist for Knowles,
   and later for Barack Obama, told me. “She was this dowdy, but very
   attractive, person who drew a lot of support from progressive women.
   She was serious business.”

   But even before she left the state, she let herself be distracted by
   the many grievances she harbored against a wide range of enemies. When
   I was in Juneau, a draft memoir by one of her former aides, Frank
   Bailey, was leaked to a number of political insiders, and from one of
   them to me. The manuscript’s memorable quality is its rendering of
   Palin and what it was like to work with her. Bailey was cast aside
   after years of loyal service and has an ax to grind. But his portrait
   is persuasive nonetheless, because he peppers his book with internal
   e-mails that he kept, from Palin and her staff.

   Bailey says their “enemy number one” was a local conservative radio
   host to whom she would listen for hours, fuming. Ugly rumors of the
   sort common in politics were another fixation, as this e-mail furnished
   by Bailey attests:

   Palin obsessed over her image, even more than most politicians.
   According to Bailey, she orchestrated a campaign to inundate newspapers
   with phony letters praising her. This evidently became a favored
   tactic. Bailey even includes a letter he says she wrote under another
   name accusing an opponent, John Binkley, of copying her Web-site
   design. (Excerpt: “This may not seem like such a big deal, but not
   having an original idea and taking credit for someone else’s work gives
   us a clue of how Johne [sic] works.”) In the idiom of the Web, Palin
   was a troll.

   Much of this was harmless (if also pointless) and would not have
   undermined her political career. Politicians from Nixon to Clinton have
   been similarly consumed and still flourished. But Palin also committed
   more-serious ethical breaches. The most notorious of these involved her
   attempts to get her former brother-in-law, a state trooper, fired, and
   included Palin’s removal of the trooper’s boss when he didn’t comply
   with her wish. An investigation by the legislature found that, in some
   of her actions, she had abused her powers.

   Palin seems to have been driven by a will to advance herself and by a
   virulent animus against anyone who tried to impede her. But this didn’t
   prevent her from being an uncommonly effective governor, while she
   lasted. On the big issues, at least, she chose her enemies well, and
   left the state in better shape than most people, herself included, seem
   to realize or want to credit her for. It’s odd that someone so
   preoccupied with her image hasn’t gotten this across better. And it
   raises the question of what she could have achieved.

   “The thing that strikes me again and again is that she was so
   single-minded when she got here,” Gregg Erickson, a former senior state
   economist and co-founder of the Alaska Budget Report, an influential
   political newsletter, told me. “The problem with amateurs in politics
   is that they often lack that focus. She had it. She was terrible at
   running a staff, and given that, it’s amazing she was successful. But
   on the issues she made the focus of her administration—the oil tax and
   the gas line—she had good staff, listened to them, and backed them up.
   She was a transformative governor, no question. If it hadn’t been for
   her stunning ability to confuse personal interests and her role as
   governor, she could have gone on to be tremendously successful.”

   John McCain’s advisers say he chose Palin because they believed that
   the race needed shaking up. But she must have appealed to him for
   reasons beyond her gender and vivacity. Palin was fresh from major,
   unexpected victories. She had challenged her own party’s corruption, at
   grave risk to her career. For this, she was wildly popular. Surely,
   that brought back McCain’s old battles against George W. Bush and the
   Republican establishment, and the glory they had won him.

   But McCain and Palin didn’t run as mavericks. Instead, they turned hard
   right. Palin’s old colleagues were stunned. “The speech at the
   Republican convention that made her a star, that was just shocking,”
   French told me. “She could have said, ‘I’ll do for the nation what I
   did for Alaska: I’ll work with both sides and won’t care where the
   ideas come from.’ Her background supported that. Instead, they handed
   her a red-meat script she’s been reading from ever since.”

   After the election, Palin returned to being governor, but she didn’t
   last long. She says unwarranted ethics investigations are what prompted
   her to quit. Most Alaskans seem to think she left to get rich. But she
   also had lost her political base. Republicans had never liked her,
   Democrats felt betrayed, and everyone believed she was now fixated on
   the presidency. Today, only about 33 percent of Alaskans hold a
   favorable view of her. She’s often referred to as [69]“Sarah,
   Inc.”—just the latest powerful entity seeking to exploit Alaska.

   Palin’s departure has had further consequences. Her successor and
   former lieutenant governor, Sean Parnell, is in many respects her
   opposite: a pleasant man who makes so little impression that some
   Republicans call him “Captain Zero.” You don’t imagine him going rogue.
   But Alaskans seem relieved to have him in charge.

   Parnell is also a former oil lobbyist for ConocoPhillips. While serving
   out Palin’s term, he was a dutiful caretaker of her legacy. But in
   December, having been elected in his own right, he decided to make some
   changes, and began by firing the remaining members of the Magnificent
   Seven. Then, in January, he announced that his top priority was a bill
   cutting ACES by $2 billion a year. Parnell claims that the tax
   discourages oil investments in Alaska, although there’s little evidence
   to back that up. The Resource Development Council for Alaska, a leading
   business lobbying group, has taken up this cause in earnest. Most
   legislators give Parnell even odds of succeeding. Everyone agrees that
   the oil industry is reasserting itself, now that Palin has moved on.

   Let’s stop here and go back for a moment to the convention speech—the
   alchemic moment of excitement and fantasy when Sarah Palin became the
   star of national politics. Listening to it today, you can practically
   hear her shift registers, the state figure morphing into a national
   one, the old Palin becoming the new. She touches on the pipeline, the
   corruption, how she broke the oil companies’ “monopoly on power” and
   ended a “culture of self-dealing.” But all of that is overshadowed by
   the full-throated assault on Barack Obama, rooted in deep cultural
   resentment, that became the campaign’s ethos and remains Palin’s
   identity. What resonate are her charges that Obama wanted to “forfeit”
   the war in Iraq and that he condescended to “working people” with talk
   of “how bitterly they cling to their religion and guns.”

   That didn’t carry her to Washington, but it did reshape the contours of
   American politics. Today, there aren’t many Republicans of the type
   Palin was in Alaska; but nearly every Republican seeking the White
   House strives to evoke the more grievance-driven themes of her
   convention speech. Regardless of whether she runs too, her influence
   will be more broadly and deeply felt than anyone else’s. But it’s hard
   to believe that her party, or her country, or even Palin herself, is
   better off for that.

   What if history had written a different ending? What if she had tried
   to do for the nation what she did for Alaska? The possibility is
   tantalizing and not hard to imagine. The week after the Republican
   convention, Lehman Brothers collapsed, and the whole economy suddenly
   seemed poised to go down with it. Palin might have been the torchbearer
   of reform, a role that would have come naturally. Everything about
   her—the aggressiveness, the gift for articulating resentments, her
   record and even her old allies in Alaska—would once more have been
   channeled against a foe worth pursuing. Palin, not Obama, might
   ultimately have come to represent “Change We Can Believe In.” What had
   he done that could possibly compare with how she had faced down special
   interests in Alaska?

   Where true Palinism could be most productively applied is on the issues
   consuming Washington right now: debt and deficits. Palin’s achievement
   was to pull Alaska out of a dire, corrupt, enduring systemic crisis and
   return it to fiscal health and prosperity when many people believed
   that such a thing was impossible. She did this not by hewing to any
   ideological extreme but by setting a pragmatic course, applying a
   rigorous practicality to a set of problems that had seemed impervious
   to solution. She challenged supposedly inviolable political precepts,
   and embraced more-nuanced realities: Republicans sometimes must
   confront powerful business interests; to govern effectively, you have
   to cooperate with the other side; you sometimes must raise taxes to
   balance a budget; and doing these things can actually enhance rather
   than destroy your career, whatever anybody says. True reform—not
   pandering to the base—established Palin’s broad popularity in Alaska.
   This approach is sorely absent from most of what happens in Washington
   these days.

   You’d of course have to account for her flaws, already evident back
   home, which would undoubtedly have materialized. But had she run as a
   reformer, these would have amounted to a character trait—not her
   defining trait—and one shared by many successful politicians. It’s
   amazing what the media can see fit to forgive in someone who they are
   convinced is a true maverick. Just look at her running mate!

   But Palin isn’t the type to feel regret. And her choice of a different
   kind of political celebrity isn’t likely to be her biggest obstacle.
   Rather, she’ll have to overcome a lack of experience, long odds of
   winning, and a Republican establishment whose leaders are deeply
   hostile to the idea of her candidacy. That’s why most people in
   Washington believe she won’t run. But in Alaska, they’re not so sure.
   The Palin they knew faced many of the same obstacles, and nothing about
   her charmed career, from mayor to governor to vice-presidential nominee
   and finally to global celebrity, suggests to them that she would ever
   be deterred.

  I Was a Muslim in Trump's White House

     * [79]Rumana Ahmed

   When President Obama left, I stayed on at the National Security Council
   in order to serve my country. I lasted eight days.

   In 2011, I was hired, straight out of college, to work at the White
   House and eventually the National Security Council. My job there was to
   promote and protect the best of what my country stands for. I am a
   hijab-wearing Muslim woman––I was the only hijabi in the West Wing––and
   the Obama administration always made me feel welcome and included.

   Like most of my fellow American Muslims, I spent much of 2016 watching
   with consternation as Donald Trump vilified our community. Despite
   this––or because of it––I thought I should try to stay on the NSC staff
   during the Trump Administration, in order to give the new president and
   his aides a more nuanced view of Islam, and of America's Muslim
   citizens.

  Why Nothing Works Anymore

     * [81]Ian Bogost

   Technology has its own purposes.

   “No… it’s a magic potty,” my daughter used to lament, age 3 or so,
   before refusing to use a public restroom stall with an automatic-flush
   toilet. As a small person, she was accustomed to the infrared sensor
   detecting erratic motion at the top of her head and violently flushing
   beneath her. Better, in her mind, just to delay relief than to subject
   herself to the magic potty’s dark dealings.

   It’s hardly just a problem for small people. What adult hasn’t suffered
   the pneumatic public toilet’s whirlwind underneath them? Or again when
   attempting to exit the stall? So many ordinary objects and experiences
   have become technologized—made dependent on computers, sensors, and
   other apparatuses meant to improve them—that they have also ceased to
   work in their usual manner. It’s common to think of such defects as
   matters of bad design. That’s true, in part. But technology is also
   more precarious than it once was. Unstable, and unpredictable. At least
   from the perspective of human users. From the vantage point of
   technology, if it can be said to have a vantage point, it's evolving
   separately from human use.

  When Evidence Says No, but Doctors Say Yes

     * [83]David Epstein and [84]ProPublica

   Long after research contradicts common medical practices, patients
   continue to demand them and physicians continue to deliver. The result
   is an epidemic of unnecessary and unhelpful treatments.

   First, listen to the story with the happy ending: At 61, the executive
   was in excellent health. His blood pressure was a bit high, but
   everything else looked good, and he exercised regularly. Then he had a
   scare. He went for a brisk post-lunch walk on a cool winter day, and
   his chest began to hurt. Back inside his office, he sat down, and the
   pain disappeared as quickly as it had come.

   That night, he thought more about it: middle-aged man, high blood
   pressure, stressful job, chest discomfort. The next day, he went to a
   local emergency department. Doctors determined that the man had not
   suffered a heart attack and that the electrical activity of his heart
   was completely normal. All signs suggested that the executive had
   stable angina—chest pain that occurs when the heart muscle is getting
   less blood-borne oxygen than it needs, often because an artery is
   partially blocked.

  What on Earth Is Going On With the Stock Market?

     * [86]Derek Thompson

   Millions of Americans are worried that Donald Trump is an ominous
   figure. Investors have another theory: maybe not.

   Donald Trump so permeates the collective consciousness of the country
   that it is hard to imagine now living in a world without him. But there
   is one place where the president seems to be relatively invisible—the
   U.S. stock market.

   The Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq have set[87] record highs in the months after
   Trump’s election. On Thursday, the Dow has its tenth consecutive record
   closing in a row, at 20,810. This is happening, despite the fact that
   investors[88] seemed terrified of a Trump presidency in the general
   election campaign. Trump came into office promising to antagonize
   America’s allies and economic partners while crushing the international
   establishment. None of this is particularly favorable to multinational
   corporations. Even worse, Trump’s first few weeks in office were a
   maelstrom of hasty lawmaking and furious backtracking, exactly the sort
   of behavior one might consider a threat to the all-important
   “certainty” that markets ostensibly crave. What’s more, mainstream
   economists are nearly[89] united in their certainty that Trump’s core
   policies, like scrapping free trade agreements while severely limiting
   immigration, would be bad for the country.

  Kansas Republicans Sour on Their Tax-Cut Experiment

     * [91]Russell Berman

   The state legislature nearly reversed Governor Sam Brownback’s
   signature policy after a voter rebellion. His economic legacy, one GOP
   lawmaker says, “is going down in flames.”

   It was only two months ago that Governor Sam Brownback was offering up
   the steep tax cuts he enacted in Kansas [92]as a model for President
   Trump to follow. Yet by the time Republicans in Congress get around to
   tax reform, Brownback’s fiscal plan could be history—and it’ll be his
   own party that kills it.

   The GOP-controlled legislature in Kansas [93]nearly reversed the
   conservative governor’s tax cuts on Tuesday, as a coalition of
   Democrats and newly-elected centrist Republicans came within a few
   votes of overriding Brownback’s veto of legislation to raise income-tax
   rates and eliminate an exemption for small businesses that blew an
   enormous hole in the state’s budget. Brownback’s tax cuts survive for
   now, but lawmakers and political observers view the surprising votes in
   the state House and Senate as a strong sign that the five-year-old
   policy will be substantially erased in a final budget deal this spring.
   Kansas legislators must close a $346 million deficit by June, and years
   of borrowing and quick fixes have left them with few remaining options
   aside from tax hikes or deep spending cuts to education that could be
   challenged in court. The tax bill would have raised revenues by more
   than $1 billion over two years.

  The Bow-Tied Bard of Populism

   Tucker Carlson’s latest reinvention is guided by a simple principle—a
   staunch aversion to whatever his right-minded neighbors believe.

   Tucker Carlson is selling me hard on the swamp. It is an unseasonably
   warm afternoon in late January, and we are seated at a corner table in
   Monocle, an upscale Capitol Hill restaurant frequented by the Fox News
   star. (Carlson, who typically skips breakfast and spends dinnertime on
   the air, is a fan of the long, luxurious, multi-course lunch, and when
   I requested an interview he proposed we do it here.) As we scan the
   menus, I mention that I’ll be moving soon to the Washington area, and
   he promptly launches into an enthusiastic recitation of the district’s
   many virtues and amenities.

   “I’m so pathetically eager for people to love D.C.,” he admits. “It’s
   so sad. It’s like I work for the chamber of commerce or something.”

  Paul Ryan's Tax Plan May Not Do What Trump Says It Will

     * [98]Andrew McGill

   The president appears to be considering a border adjustment tax, which
   many economists favor. But its supporters warn it won’t give him what
   he wants.

   For as loudly as Donald Trump complains about foreign trade, it’s hard
   to pin him to specifics. Does he prefer a [99]20 percent tariff on
   Mexican imports? Or a [100]45 percent tax on companies that move jobs
   overseas? Or… something else?

   On Thursday, the president made his position a bit more clear. [101]In
   an interview with Reuters, he praised a proposal by House Speaker Paul
   Ryan to broadly tax imports but remove taxes on exports, a core
   component of [102]the Republican “Better Way” blueprint.

   Ryan wants the “border adjustment” as part of a larger refactoring of
   the American tax code, something fiscal conservatives have sought for a
   long time. But Trump doesn’t appear to care about tax reform. He just
   wants domestic job growth.

  The Meaning of Kim Jong Nam's Murder

     * [104]Suki Kim

   His death has punctured the myth of the Kims' holy bloodline.

   As the first son of Kim Jong Il, the late leader of the Democratic
   People’s Republic of Korea, Kim Jong Nam always posed a threat to Kim
   Jong Un, his half brother and North Korea’s current leader. Before
   falling out of favor with his father and going into [105]exile soon
   after, paving the way for Kim Jong Un’s ascent, Kim Jong Nam was the
   heir apparent. With the execution in 2013 of Jang Sung Tak, the second
   in command and the eldest son’s staunchest supporter, Kim Jong Nam was
   unprotected, with little hope of ever returning home.

   On February 13, Kim Jong Nam was [106]murdered in Kuala Lumpur airport
   by two hired killers. The fascination surrounding the killing has
   centered on its sensational circumstances: that [107]one of the killers
   smeared a poisonous toxin, reportedly [108]VX gas, across Kim’s face;
   that one of them wore a T-shirt with the acronym “LOL” printed across
   the front; that the other reportedly mistook the hit for a comedy
   stunt. Malaysian police have detained five people allegedly connected
   to the killing, and remain on the hunt for others—including several
   North Koreans—linked to it.

  The Politics of Retelling Norse Mythology

     * [111]Lisa L. Hannett

   Neil Gaiman’s remarkable new book has triggered a debate about who,
   exactly, owns pagan tales.

   Myths are funny. Unlike histories, they are symbolic narratives; they
   deal with spiritual rather than fact-based truths. They serve as
   foundations for beliefs, illustrating how things came to be and who was
   involved, but they’re often sketchy about when or why. There’s a brief
   scene from Neil Gaiman’s new book Norse Mythology that does a
   remarkable job of capturing just this: the wonderfully nebulous sense
   of being in illo tempore—the hazy “at that time” of the mythic past. It
   begins, as many creation myths do, with “an empty place waiting to be
   filled with life,” but in this instance some life already exists.
   There’s Ymir, whose enormous body produces all giants and, eventually,
   the earth, skies, and seas. There’s Audhumla, the celestial cow, who
   licks the first gods out of blocks of ice. And there are three
   brothers—the gods Ve, Vili, and Odin—who must devise a way out of this
   timeless nowhere:

  How to Build an Autocracy

     * [113]David Frum

   The preconditions are present in the U.S. today. Here’s the playbook
   Donald Trump could use to set the country down a path toward
   illiberalism.

   It’s 2021, and President Donald Trump will shortly be sworn in for his
   second term. The 45th president has visibly aged over the past four
   years. He rests heavily on his daughter Ivanka’s arm during his
   infrequent public appearances.

   Fortunately for him, he did not need to campaign hard for reelection.
   His has been a popular presidency: Big tax cuts, big spending, and big
   deficits have worked their familiar expansive magic. Wages have grown
   strongly in the Trump years, especially for men without a college
   degree, even if rising inflation is beginning to bite into the gains.
   The president’s supporters credit his restrictive immigration policies
   and his TrumpWorks infrastructure program.
