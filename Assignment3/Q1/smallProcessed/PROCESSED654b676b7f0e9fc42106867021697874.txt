   training. I was teaching sales and marketing skills from 1998 in
   London, trained as a facilitator in Phoenix, Arizona, in 2005 and also

Really Helpful

   by Jan Graham

   The course was very helpful in helping me work out the first steps of
   digital marketing plan for my book.

   by Aaron Yeoman
   ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )
   Well set out course with 'bite-size' chunks of information summarized
   on screen and elaborated upon in audio format. Some new insights and
   author-specific advice not found in more generic marketing courses.

Excellent, a very comprehensive guide to marketing your book

   by Maxine Sylvester
   ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )
   Gives you a full background for what you will need to market your book,
   it will need plenty of your time, but if it is what you want then you
   need to put in that time and effort. I have not tried any of the paid
   courses, but would certainly look at them after I have understood the
   basics. Thank you Laurence

It's a great course for a youthful marketer

   by Grace Chang
   ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )
   I use the word "youthful marketer". I beg you get what I mean. :) I'm a
   youthful marketer. This course stresses on the objectives. It's so
   helpful. A newbie like me can easily forget to put this into
   consideration. Ouch, that hurts. Objective is very important! I'm
   working on the contents on my website, Pinterest and YouTube. Take a
   deep breathe. If I can do it, you can do it. This is a great course to
   get a good foundation!

Great Introduction to DM

   by Bhagya Chandrashekar

   The course was very helpful. I am one to shy away from DM but there is
   such potential here, I cannot overlook. Thank you.

Excellent Introduction to Digital Marketing

   by Marlyn Mohs
   ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )
   I am a complete newbie to the DM world. Before I completed my book, I
   avoided social media partially because I didn't really understand it.
   My daughter made a Twitter for me and a FB that I still don't fully
   understand. So, you can imagine how out of sync I am and how
   desperately I need to organize my approach and my efforts. This course
   has given me a general intro to everything DM. It has clarified a lot
   for me. Definitely time well spent!

   I appreciated this course that broke down the big picture of Digital
   Marketing into bite sized pieces that made sense. Then giving the next
   steps when I had finished digesting what had been served. Thankyou

Great overview

   by Michael Rogers

   The lessons were a great general overview to help set up for more

   wait!

A great mini course for Authors

   This miniature course for Authors was informative and concise. The step

   and provide some great tips on marketing strategies for the modern age.

My thoughts on BooksGoSocial's marketing course

   by Jaye Marie
   ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )
   This is the very first on line course I have ever taken, and I found it
   really informative. Some of the points I was familiar with, but there
   was much that was news to me. It certainly gave me a lot to think
   about, and I am sure my marketing skills will improve because of it.

Basics of Digital Marketing For Authors

   The information contained in this course will help many authors achieve
   their dreams.

An excellent resource

   by Carmel Audsley
   ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )
   Everyone, regardless of your proficiency with digital media, can learn
   something from the Basics of Digital Marketing course. It is presented
   in an informative way, with each step explained. As writers, you can
   sometimes feel that the time spent marketing your book/s is taking time
   away from your writing, but the two go hand in hand. If you can get the
   basics of digital marketing in place, it will be easier to promote each
   of your books as they are written.

Free Marketing Course

   by Phil Phoenix
   ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )
   Having taken this course I realised how much I didn't know, and how
   much Lawrence knows about marketing. The value of this course is beyond
   what I thought and is a must for any writer who wants good solid book
   sales. Phil Phoenix - author of The JET! Trilogy.

Decent overview of a very broad topic

   by Marcel St. Pierre
   ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )
   Very happy with this course - glad to have had this be my first foray
   into the 'booksgosocialtraining' series. Laurence was knowledgeable,
   didn't delve into (as he says) 'flim flam' and 'jargon' and spoke with
   just the right amount of an Irish lilt. Enjoyable and a breeze to get
   through, plus it made me super happy to realize I'm already doing a lot
   of the things he covered... just a few more steps on my part to make
   specific, attainable goals. Thanks to everybody who put this together.
