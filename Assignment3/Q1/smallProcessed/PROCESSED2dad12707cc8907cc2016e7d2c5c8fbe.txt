Roman Reigns' Best Booking Options for Feud vs. Rusev to Rebuild WWE Star

   A Rusev-Reigns WWE United States Championship feud could be the best
   move to rebuild the former WWE world champion.

   Roman Reigns' loss to Finn Balor during last week's episode of WWE Raw
   was the final act in the former champion's run as the show's top
   babyface.

   Instead, Reigns, who has been fighting for the company's top title for
   more than a year, had to find a new path to redemption.

   As WWE fans found out on Monday night: when one door closes, another
   opens.

   Instead of using Raw's main event scene to build Reigns back up, or
   turning The Big Dog into a heel, WWE made its best move yet in the
   short career of Reigns: It moved him into the upper midcard—the place
   he should have been all along.

   Following a stirring promo by United States champ Rusev, Reigns made
   his way to the ring to challenge The Bulgarian Brute and his
   anti-American rhetoric:

     WWE @WWE

     It's @WWERomanReigns and @RusevBUL nose-to-nose. Does the
     #RomanEmpire want a piece of the US Champ? #RAW
     https://t.co/mzZdTqrRQY
     [29]8/2/2016, 1:29:01 AM

   The move was met with mixed reactions by those on social media. Some
   believed Reigns had finally found his place in the WWE hierarchy.
   Others felt a returning Kurt Angle would have been a better choice to
   defend U.S. interests in the ring. And for some, Reigns can do no
   right:

     Donald Wood @Donald_Wood

     Roman Reigns fighting Rusev for the #USTitle is exactly where he
     belongs on the card. #WWERaw
     [30]8/2/2016, 1:28:56 AM

     Ryan Satin @ryansatin

     Looks like Reigns has been knocked down a peg to the upper-midcard.
     Could be what he needs to get fans behind him again, w/out a heel
     turn.

     NoDQ.com - WWE News @nodqdotcom

     I personally find the Roman Reigns as an American hero to redemption
     storyline to be boring but that's just me personally. #WWE #RAW
     [33]8/2/2016, 1:36:32 AM

   It appears Reigns and Rusev are on a collision course for SummerSlam.
   So what are the best booking options to rebuild the former champ?


Roman Reigns Loses to Rusev at SummerSlam

   A Reigns loss at SummerSlam accomplishes two goals.

   First, losing to Rusev one-on-one would complete Roman Reigns' epic
   fall, having gone from world champion to valiant loser in mere months.
   Losing to Seth Rollins, Finn Balor and Rusev in a matter of eight weeks
   would prove Reigns isn't invincible—something WWE fans have come to
   expect.

   Second, a Rusev win makes The Bulgarian Brute a legitimate threat in
   the New Era. He becomes a dominant force—one of only three men to
   cleanly defeat the former world champion.

     Justin LaBar @JustinLaBar

     Roman Reigns being put down a step or two &amp; the attempt to put
     him against someone who is true heel who gets no "cool cheers." #RAW
     [34]8/2/2016, 1:44:57 AM

   Such a result would make their second matchup a must-see event. Rusev,
   riding high off a win over Reigns, would be as cocky as ever, spewing
   more vitriol at Reigns and the fans than ever before.

   And that's when Reigns can finally get back some of his mojo. Instead
   of the tired Russia-versus-America angle WWE typically uses in Rusev's
   storylines, WWE could incorporate its anti-bullying messaging—a
   campaign that features Reigns.

   It's a simple message, and one that can work in Reigns' favor.

Reigns Wins at SummerSlam, Only to Lose Title the Next Night

   If WWE has Reigns defeat Rusev at SummerSlam, it needs to have him drop
   the title to another WWE Superstar immediately.

   Only then can Reigns finally undergo the heel turn so many fans are
   anxious to see.

   The "inevitable" Roman Reigns heel-turn angle has been bandied about
   more often than most any potential storyline or rumored return.
   Everyone from [35]Stone Cold Steve Austin to [36]Vince Russo to [37]Jim
   Ross, as well as plenty of internet speculators, have talked about
   Reigns' potential as a heel.

     The New Age Insiders @NewAgeInsiders

     Dammit. Roman Reigns is taking that thing off Rusev isn't he... #RAW
     #USTitle #SummerSlam
     [38]8/2/2016, 1:29:11 AM

   Imagine: Reigns defeats Rusev at SummerSlam. Reigns defends his title
   the next night on Raw against a Superstar like Cesaro or Sami Zayn and
   loses.

   That's when Reigns snaps, spearing his opponent repeatedly. Such a
   scene wouldn't be as dramatic against Rusev, Kevin Owens or Braun
   Strowman. The only way to accomplish that is to have him lose
   unexpectedly to a true babyface—someone the crowd adores.

   And then turning on that Superstar in a most violent way.

   Such an event would complete Roman Reigns' turn to the dark
   side—something WWE fans have been longing to see.
