[4]Foods that are Best Sources of Protein

   [5][protein%2Bfood.jpg]
   Why are the proteins so important?
   Every athlete knows that protein is a very important nutrient for
   health, muscle growth, and weight loss. Also, we need to eat protein
   foods every day to keep our metabolism running and our blood sugars
   stable. Proteins are long chains of amino acids, which are very
   important molecules that we get from our diet. Without consuming enough
   of protein calories you can become deficient in amino acids
   that lead to low energy, no muscle gains, and low concentration and
   memory.
   Those are just some of the facts that show the importance of consuming
   protein foods. For lifters, protein is the main macronutrient. The king
   of macronutrients among three of them. Others macronutrients are
   carbohydrates and fats. You can't build muscle mass or lose weight in a
   healthy way without consuming proteins. So, for a conclusion of an
   importance of proteins is that you have to consume protein foods if you
   want to:
     * Build Lean Muscle Mass
     * Lose Weight
     * Be Healthy
     * Have More Energy

   What are the best sources of protein?
      1. Whey Protein Supplement
      2. Lean Meats (Chicken, Turkey, Beef)
      3. Fish (Tuna, Salmon)
      4. Nuts (Peanuts, Almonds, Walnuts)
      5. Eggs (Egg Whites)
      6. Low-Fat Dairy
      7. Beans
      8. Soy
   Last studies of protein say that ideal dose of protein per one meal is
   35 grams. Only 4 ounces of Lean Chicken Meat contains about 35 grams of
   protein and only 196 calories and 5 grams of fats. Chicken and Turkey
   meat are some of the best sources of protein. Whey Protein Supplement
   became many famous and there is no lifter that didn't hear of it. Whey
   Protein is a very good supplement and I recommend it for every athlete
   as it is a great source of clean protein, and usually contains 80 - 90
   grams of protein per 100 grams. There are also other types of Protein
   Supplements like Soy Protein, Rice Protein, Milk Protein but Whey is
   the most popular and his effect is proven a long time ago.
   So, buy a Whey Protein Supplement, make diet plan of a combination of
   foods from my list and don't forget about other two macronutrients too.
   Don't just focus on protein, but be sure that you are consuming at
   least 0.5 gram per pound to maintain muscle mass and 1 - 1.2 grams of
   protein per pound for athletes that want to build muscle mass.

[25]Reg Park's 5x5 Workout Program for Muscle Mass and Strength

   [26]reg park 5x5 workout routine
   To gain more muscle mass you have to get stronger. If you want to look
   strong and big you have to try Reg Park's 5x5 Workout Routine. It is
   great workout routine for size and strength,  that many old school
   bodybuilders used to build their powerful physique and they were much
   stronger than bodybuilders today.
   [27]Classic Bodybuilders Vs. Modern Bodybuilders
   Old school bodybuilders also spent most time performing compound
   exercises and lifting heavy weights, which recruited more muscle
   fibers, and it is better for muscle growth. In order to only get
   stronger with this routine, you shouldn't be in caloric surplus which
   you need if you want to gain muscle mass and strength with this workout
   program.
   Exercises that Reg Park used to do in his training were squats,
   deadlifts, bench presses, and power cleans. Reg Park believed that
   training to failure is a mistake, he believed in gradual progression
   for gains that last longer. The aim of his workout routine is to do 5
   sets of 5 reps with the proper weight and if you can do more than 5
   reps with that weight then increase the weight on every training day.
   But, don't increase the weight if you can't lift it for five sets of
   five reps. First two sets in Reg Park's workout routine were warm ups
   and last three were primary work sets. For an example, if you lift 200
   pounds on bench press it will look like this:
   1 Set - 5 Reps with 160 pounds
   2 Set - 5 Reps, 180 pounds
   3 Set - 5 Reps, 200 pounds
   4 Set - 5 Reps, 200 pounds
   5 Set - 5 Reps, 200 pounds
   First two sets are great for building confidence and last three sets
   are the real deal. If you can lift more weight in last three sets, it
   is time to put 5 pounds more on each set. That is the point of Reg
   Park's progression, more strength with every training day which results
   in more muscle mass.
   Reg Park's Workout Routine was split into three phases.

[46]Homemade Protein Shake for Muscle Mass

   [47]Protein Shakes for Mass
   There is no need for spending a lot of money for those mass gainers in
   gyms and supplement stores. They are full of simple carbs and there is
   a healthier and cheaper solution - HOMEMADE GAINERS.
   For skinny guys, ectomorphs that are hard-gainers and it is very hard
   for them to gain a pound of weight or muscle mass, Homemade Shakes for
   Mass are a great choice for addition in their meal plan. They can be
   consumed 1 - 3 times a day, they contain a lot of healthy calories and
   counting meals is easier with shakes. Let's say that you can eat three
   big meals that consist of proteins, carbs, and fats and consume 3
   homemade shakes that are alternative of big meals and you have 6
   high-calorie meals and you don't need to eat food whole day. Drinking
   shakes is easier, not expensive and you can choose a different flavor
   every day, for example, Homemade Shake with extract of vanilla,
   chocolate or hazelnut.
   Let's say that you split your nutrients into six meals, three meals
   that consist of food and three shake meals. If your every meal contain
   about 40 grams of protein you will consume 6 x 30 = 180 grams of
   protein and that is enough protein for one day. Add about 80 grams of
   carbs and you will have 6 x 70 = 420 grams of carbohydrates for a day,
   that is also enough. Together it makes about 2400 calories because 1
   gram of protein has 4 calories and 1 gram of carbs also 4 calories (180
   grams of proteins = 720 calories + 420 grams of carbohydrates = 1680
   calories and the result is 2400 calories). Then you should add some
   good fats to make that calories number higher. Add about 120 grams of
   fats which consist of 960 calories and you have about 3500 healthy
   calories every day. That is a pretty big number of calories and it is
   enough for many skinny guys to build muscle mass.
   Whey Protein can be a good ingredient of your homemade shake and you
   can also add eggs and milk as other sources of protein, then add some
   complex carbs (you need to consume more carbs than proteins for muscle
   building), and you have a great homemade shake for muscle mass gain.
   Ingredients recommendation for muscle-building homemade shakes:
   Protein sources: Whey Protein, Eggs, Milk
   Carbohydrate sources: Oats, Banana, Fruits
   Fats sources: Peanut Butter, Olive Oil, Cocoa
   HOMEMADE GAINERS RECIPES:
     * 1 Scoop of Whey Protein
     * 1/2 Cup of Oats
     * 1/2 Cup of Low-Fat Milk
     * 1 Raw Egg
     * 1 Tablespoon of Peanut Butter

[84]Best Exercises for Big Shoulders

   [85][Shoulders%2Bworkout.jpg]
   Building a big, round shoulders won't be an easy task, and you have to
   focus on all three heads of shoulder muscle. Anterior deltoid is
   engaged in almost all chest exercises and it is front head of shoulder
   muscle that is mostly overtrained. Lifters often don't pay attention to
   their medial and posterior deltoid, that is very bad for muscles
   balance and proportion. Training only with exercises that build a front
   head of shoulder will lead to bad body posture and shoulder injuries.
   Medial deltoid is very important for building shoulder width and
   Posterior deltoid is important for body posture and building it is
   greatly improving your body look from the back. That means, to look
   bigger and broader you have to train every side of shoulder muscle
   equally.
   To build big shoulders you have to use compound and heavy exercises
   with some additional isolation exercises. So train with heavy weights
   (about 80% of 1RM) and with rep range from 8 - 12 which is best for
   muscle gains.
   Which exercises to choose for building big shoulders?
     * Standing Military Press (Shoulder Barbell Press)
     * Dumbbell Shoulder Press (Standing or Seated)
     * Arnold Press (Variation of Dumbbell Press)
     * Dumbbell Side Lateral Raise
     * Dumbbell Rear Lateral Raise
     * Face Pull (Great for improving posture)

   ABOUT THESE EXERCISES
   Standing Military Press:
   The Standing Military Press is a great workout which targets all the
   muscle groups in your shoulder. Arching your back too much while
   performing this workout will hurt your back, so pick a weight that is
   not too heavy.
   How to perform Military Press: Grab a barbell and push it upwards then
   slowly bring the barbell down while inhaling. Keep your back straight
   through this process.
   [86]exercise for bigger shoulders
   Seated or standing dumbbell press and Arnold press can be considered as
   variations of this exercise.
   Dumbbell Side Lateral Raise:
   This exercise target you medial shoulders. Try not to swing the weights
   while performing it.
   How to perform it: Hold dumbbells at the side of your body and lift the
   dumbbells up while slightly arching your back, then slowly return
   dumbbells to the starting position.
   [87]exercises for big shoulders
   Dumbbell Rear Lateral Raise is performing similarly like Side Lateral
   Raise.
   Face Pull is an exercise that is performing on a machine by attaching
   the rope to a pulley station and set it at chest level and then pull
   the rope towards your face. Keep your arms parallel to the ground (when
   you pull the rope, stand in a biceps showing posture and then slowly
   return the rope).
   Those exercises are sufficient for your shoulders workout day and they
   are great for building muscle mass and bigger shoulders.
   Try it, check out the results and leave a comment.
