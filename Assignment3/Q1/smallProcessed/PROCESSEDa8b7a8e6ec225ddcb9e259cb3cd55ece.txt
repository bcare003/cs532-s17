Democrats slam White House over report it asked FBI to downplay Russia
stories

   Prominent Democrats on Thursday ripped the Trump administration over a
   report that it asked Federal Bureau of Investigation officials to
   publicly downplay media accounts of communications between President
   Donald Trump's team and Russian officials.

   A [103]CNN report released Thursday night citing multiple U.S.
   officials said the FBI had spurned White House calls for the bureau to
   "knock down" news stories on potential ties between Trump campaign
   officials and Russia. According to the report, White House Chief of
   Staff Reince Priebus spoke with FBI Director James Comey and Deputy
   Director Andrew McCabe about having the bureau publicly correct what
   the administration believed to be factually incorrect reporting.

   Story Continued Below

   The White House Thursday night confirmed the conversation having taken
   place on Feb. 15, but said that McCabe initiated the discussion with
   Priebus to communicate that a New York Times [104]report a day earlier
   about the FBI investigating conversations between Trump campaign
   staffers and Russian officials was, in the FBI's view, overstating the
   nature of their investigation.

   "To be clear, it was the FBI that contacted the White House to rebut
   the New York Times' story," White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer
   said Thursday night. "We merely asked them to inform journalists of the
   same point that they were making to us."

   However, according to the CNN report, Priebus reached out later to FBI
   Director James Comey after McCabe explained the agency couldn't make
   such a public statement amid an ongoing investigation. Comey, CNN
   reports, also rejected Priebus' subsequent request.

   Former Obama administration official and ethics czar Norm Eisen called
   Priebus' request "shocking" and said any such interactions between
   White House and intelligence officials are "forbidden," adding that had
   these events occurred in the previous administration Priebus would have
   had to resign.

   "Where will [the] transgressions end?" Eisen [105]tweeted.

   House Judiciary Committee ranking member John Conyers said the report
   was cause for bipartisan concern, renewing a call for Attorney General
   Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from an investigation into what he
   called "clear ties" between the Trump administration and Russian
   officials.

[108]Takeaways from a week of raucous town halls

   By [109]Kyle Cheney

   "The need for an independent, bipartisan investigation into these
   matters has never been more clear," he said. "The Trump team has clear
   ties to the Russian government—and we ignore those ties at our own
   peril."

   Several other former federal employees blasted the actions as improper.

   Former Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security
   official Juliette Kayyem blasted Priebus' reported actions as "so
   wrong" and "so desperate." Another Justice Department alum, Matthew
   Miller, called the interaction "beyond inappropriate," adding that it
   "veers dangerously close to tampering with an investigation."

   Brian Fallon, former press secretary to Democratic nominee Hillary
   Clinton, responded to the story by alluding to the FBI Director's
   letter to Congress about reopening the investigation into Clinton's
   emails.

   "On the plus side, this story means Comey is going to leak word of any
   attempt by Trump WH to meddle in his inquiry," Fallon [110]wrote on
   Twitter Thursday.

   Eli Stokols contributed to this report.
