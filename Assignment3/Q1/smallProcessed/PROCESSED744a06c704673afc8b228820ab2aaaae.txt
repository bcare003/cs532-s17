   ROME — When Stephen K. Bannon was still heading Breitbart News, he went
   to the [16]Vatican to cover the canonization of John Paul II and make
   some friends. High on his list of people to meet was an
   archconservative American cardinal, Raymond Burke, who had openly
   clashed with [17]Pope Francis.

   In one of the cardinal’s antechambers, amid religious statues and
   book-lined walls, Cardinal Burke and Mr. Bannon — who is now President
   Trump’s anti-establishment eminence — bonded over their shared
   worldview. They saw Islam as threatening to overrun a prostrate West
   weakened by the erosion of traditional Christian values, and viewed
   themselves as unjustly ostracized by out-of-touch political elites.

   “When you recognize someone who has sacrificed in order to remain true
   to his principles and who is fighting the same kind of battles in the
   cultural arena, in a different section of the battlefield, I’m not
   surprised there is a meeting of hearts,” said Benjamin Harnwell, a
   confidant of Cardinal Burke who arranged the 2014 meeting.

   While Mr. Trump, a twice-divorced president who has boasted of groping
   women, may seem an unlikely ally of traditionalists in the Vatican,
   many of them regard his election and the ascendance of Mr. Bannon as
   potentially game-changing breakthroughs.

   Just as Mr. Bannon has connected with far-right parties threatening to
   topple governments throughout Western Europe, he has also made common
   cause with elements in the Roman Catholic Church who oppose the
   direction Francis is taking them. Many share Mr. Bannon’s suspicion of
   Pope Francis as a dangerously misguided, and probably socialist,
   pontiff.

   Until now, Francis has marginalized or demoted the traditionalists,
   notably Cardinal Burke, carrying out an inclusive agenda on migration,
   climate change and poverty that has made the pope a figure of unmatched
   global popularity, especially among liberals. Yet in a newly turbulent
   world, Francis is suddenly a lonelier figure. Where once Francis had a
   powerful ally in the White House in Barack Obama, now there is Mr.
   Trump and Mr. Bannon, this new president’s ideological guru.

Trump’s Campaign Chief

   In August, Donald J. Trump shook up his presidential campaign for the
   second time in two months, hiring Stephen K. Bannon, the executive
   chairman of Breitbart News, as the Republican campaign’s chief
   executive.

   For many of the pope’s ideological opponents in and around the Vatican,
   who are fearful of a pontiff they consider outwardly avuncular but
   internally a ruthless wielder of absolute political power, this angry
   moment in history is an opportunity to derail what they see as a
   disastrous papal agenda. And in Mr. Trump, and more directly in Mr.
   Bannon, some self-described “Rad Trads” — or radical traditionalists —
   see an alternate leader who will stand up for traditional Christian
   values and against Muslim interlopers.

   “There are huge areas where we and the pope do overlap, and as a loyal
   Catholic, I don’t want to spend my life fighting against the pope on
   issues where I won’t change his mind,” Mr. Harnwell said over a lunch
   of cannelloni. “Far more valuable for me would be spend time working
   constructively with Steve Bannon.”

   He made it clear he was speaking for himself, not for the [24]Institute
   for Human Dignity, a conservative Catholic group that he founded, and
   insisted that he shared the pope’s goals of ensuring peace and ending
   poverty, just not his ideas on how to achieve it.

   Mr. Bannon publicly articulated his worldview in remarks a few months
   after his meeting with Cardinal Burke, at a Vatican conference
   organized by Mr. Harnwell’s institute.

   Speaking via video feed from Los Angeles, Mr. Bannon, a Catholic,
   [26]held forth against rampant secularization, the existential threat
   of Islam, and a capitalism that had drifted from the moral foundations
   of Christianity.

Pope Francis’ Race Against Time to Reshape the Church

   Can the 79-year-old pontiff appoint enough like-minded cardinals to
   ensure that his vision of the Roman Catholic Church will endure after
   he dies?

   That talk has garnered much attention, and approval by conservatives,
   for its explicit expression of Mr. Bannon’s vision. Less widely known
   are his efforts to cultivate strategic alliances with those in Rome who
   share his interpretation of a right-wing “[28]church militant”
   theology.

   Mr. Bannon’s visage, speeches and endorsement of Mr. Harnwell as “the
   smartest guy in Rome” are featured heavily on the website of Mr.
   Harnwell’s foundation. Mr. Trump’s senior adviser has maintained email
   contact with Cardinal Burke, according to Mr. Harnwell, who dropped by
   the cardinal’s residence after lunch. And another person with knowledge
   of Mr. Bannon’s current outreach said the White House official is
   personally calling his contacts in Rome for thoughts on who should be
   the Trump administration’s ambassador to the Holy See.

   During Mr. Bannon’s April 2014 trip he courted Edward Pentin, a leading
   conservative Vatican reporter, as a potential correspondent in Rome for
   Breitbart, the website that is popular with the alt-right, a far-right
   movement that has attracted white supremacists.

   “He really seemed to get the battles the church needs to fight,” said
   Mr. Pentin, the author of “The Rigging of a Vatican Synod?” a book
   asserting that Pope Francis and his supporters railroaded opponents.
   Chief among those battles, Mr. Pentin said, was Mr. Bannon’s focus on
   countering a “cultural Marxism” that had seeped into the church.

   Since that visit and the meeting with Cardinal Burke — an experience
   that Daniel Fluette, the head of production for Breitbart, described as
   “incredibly powerful” for Mr. Bannon — Mr. Trump’s ideological
   strategist has maintained a focus on Rome.

   Mr. Bannon returned to direct the documentary “[32]Torchbearer,” in
   which the “Duck Dynasty” star Phil Robertson contemplates the
   apocalyptic consequences of an eroding Christendom. Mr. Bannon also
   reunited with old friends, including [33]Breitbart’s eventual Rome
   correspondent, Thomas Williams.

   A former priest, Mr. Williams said that he used to have arguments with
   Mr. Bannon about whether the pope subscribed to a hard-left brand of
   liberation theology, with Mr. Bannon calling the pope a
   “socialist/communist.” Mr. Williams said he usually defended the pope,
   but that recent statements by Francis convinced him “Steve turned out
   to be right. That happens more often than not.”

   Mr. Bannon’s private thoughts about the pope have at times surfaced in
   public.

   On May 23, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Williams spoke about Pope Francis on the
   radio program Breitbart News Daily.

   Discussing a Breitbart article about the new mayor of London titled
   “Pope Hails Election of Sadiq Khan, Celebrates Mass Muslim Migration
   Into Europe,” Mr. Bannon suggested that the pope “seems almost to be
   putting the responsibility on the working men and women of Italy and
   Europe et cetera, that they have to go out of their way to accommodate”
   migration.

   Was the pope a global elitist, Mr. Bannon asked, “two or three steps
   removed from this?”

   Many critics of Francis express similar views, but they are often
   scared to express it for fear of retribution from the pope, who, they
   say, has eyes and ears all over the Vatican.

   Instead, the pope’s critics anonymously papered Rome over the weekend
   with posters of a grumpy-looking Francis above complaints about his
   removing and ignoring clerics and cardinals. “Where’s your mercy?” it
   asked.

   Conservatives and traditionalists in the Vatican secretly pass around
   phony mock-ups of the Vatican’s official paper, L’Osservatore Romano,
   making fun of the pope. Or they spread a YouTube video critiquing the
   pope and his exhortation on love in the family, “Amoris Laetitia,”
   which many traditionalists consider Francis’ opening salvo against the
   doctrine of the church. Set to the music of “That’s Amore,” an
   aggrieved crooner sings, “When will we all be freed from this cruel
   tyranny, that’s Amoris” and “It’s the climate of fear engineered for
   four years, that’s Amoris.”

   Cardinal Burke — who has said that the pope’s exhortation, which opened
   the door for divorced Catholics remarried outside the church to receive
   communion, might require [41]“a formal act of correction” — has been
   unusually outspoken in his criticism of Francis. Cardinal Burke and Mr.
   Bannon declined to comment for this article.

   Just weeks ago, the pope stripped Cardinal Burke of his remaining
   institutional influence after a [42]scandal exploded at the Knights of
   Malta, a nearly 1,000-year-old chivalrous order where he had been
   exiled as a liaison to the Vatican. The pope had removed the order’s
   grand master after he showed disobedience to the pope. There was a
   sense in the order that the grand master followed the lead of Cardinal
   Burke because he projected authority, a power that stemmed in part from
   his support by the Trump administration, one influential knight said.

   Cardinal Burke has become a champion to conservatives in the United
   States. Under Mr. Bannon, Breitbart News urged its Rome correspondent
   to write sympathetically about him. And at a meeting before last
   month’s anti-abortion March for Life rally in Washington, Cardinal
   Burke received the Law of Life Achievement, or Nail award, a framed
   replica of the nail used to hold the feet of Christ to the cross.
   According to John-Henry Westen, the editor of [44]Life Site News, who
   announced the award, the prize is awarded to Christians “who have
   received a stab in the back.”

   Despite Mr. Bannon’s inroads in Rome, Mr. Burke and other
   traditionalists are not ascendant in the Vatican.

   The Rev. Antonio Spadaro, a Jesuit priest who edits the
   Vatican-approved journal La Civilta Cattolica and who is close to the
   pope, dismissed their criticism as the stuff of a noisy but small “echo
   chamber.”

   He also played down the effect of Mr. Trump’s ascent on the standing of
   Francis’ opponents in the Vatican, saying it was only on a “level of
   image” and “propaganda.”

   Advertisement
   [45]Continue reading the main story

   The pope will maintain his direction and not be distracted by fights
   against those trying to undercut him, Father Spadaro said. “He moves
   forward, and he moves ahead very fast.”

   He added that Mr. Trump’s ban on immigrants from certain Muslim
   countries was “opposite” to the pontiff’s vision for how to foster
   unity and peace. The pope, Father Spadaro said, is doing everything he
   can to avoid the clash of civilizations that both fundamentalist
   Muslims and Christians want.

   Indeed, the pope does not seem to be slowing down.

   Days after the election of Mr. Trump, in St. Peter’s Basilica, the
   Vatican officially elevated new cardinals selected by Pope Francis who
   reflected the pope’s emphasis on an inclusive church — far from the
   worldview of Mr. Bannon and Mr. Burke.

   “It’s not that he is just bringing new people in that think maybe like
   him,” Cardinal Blase Cupich, the influential new cardinal of Chicago,
   said after the ceremony. “He is transforming the church in making us
   rethink how we have done things before.”

   That transformation was evident later in the evening, when the old
   conservative guard came to pay their respects to the new cardinals.

   João Braz de Aviz, a powerful cardinal close to the pope, walked around
   in simple cleric clothes, the equivalent of civilian dress among all
   the flowing cassocks. Asked whether the ascent of Mr. Trump would
   embolden Mr. Bannon’s allies in the Vatican to intensify their
   opposition and force the pope to take a more orthodox line, he
   shrugged.

   “The doctrine is secure,” he said, adding that the mission of the
   church was more to safeguard the poor. It was also, he reminded his
   traditionalist colleagues, to serve St. Peter, whose authority is
   passed down through the popes. “And today, Francis is Peter.”
