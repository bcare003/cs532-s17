Examining Mojo Rawley's Direction, Upside and Long-Term Potential

   Credit: WWE.com
   [28]Ryan DilbertWWE Lead WriterJuly 22, 2016

   WWE is guaranteed high-watt energy with Mojo Rawley—not growth, not
   success.

   The newest SmackDown Superstar has the kind of physical assets that the
   company drools over, but in his early career, he's been unable to
   translate those into much of anything.

   His passion is undeniable. The same isn't true for his chances to make
   an impact.

   A former defensive lineman with the Arizona Cardinals, Rawley joined
   WWE developmental brand NXT in 2013.

   He spent the early part of his tenure there going undefeated, looking
   like someone the company clearly wanted to succeed. Rawley's momentum
   slowed, though, as he slid down the card and became more of a stepping
   stone for others.

   More recently, he and Zack Ryder formed The Hype Bros, taking on NXT's
   top tag teams.

   Rawley's character hadn't changed much. He was still a charged-up,
   smiling babyface with bowl-you-over power. Partnering with Ryder
   allowed him to lean on a veteran, to provide just bursts of action in
   any given match rather than be its main focus.

   In a surprise move, WWE drafted Rawley to SmackDown on Tuesday night.

   He hasn't looked nearly ready to make that leap. And a ton of names,
   from Shinsuke Nakamura to Bayley, would have been shrewder picks for
   the blue brand.

   Jeremy Botter of FloSports was apparently flustered by the move:

     Mojo Rawley called up to the main roster before Nakamura or Joe. I
     give up.

   Can Rawley make that draft pick look smart in retrospect? Can he tap
   into the potential WWE clearly sees in him?

   It won't be his athleticism that holds him back.


Strengths

   When officials dreamed up the WWE Performance Center, Rawley was likely
   the kind of athlete they had in mind for the facility.

   His football experience and his size (6'4", 240 pounds) gives WWE
   trainers tons to work with. He's strong, explosive and looks like he
   belongs in the ring. From the start of his NXT career, he wowed with
   his footwork and the ease with which he bounded across the ring.

   In the words of Enzo Amore, "You can't teach that."

   WWE wants a guy like him to succeed. He is easy to sell as larger than
   life. He has a sports background it can trumpet. He fits the physical
   mold for a WWE Superstar.

   And his never-ending energy is right at home in the squared circle, a
   world of loud and vibrant characters.


Obstacles

   Rawley's act is a one-note song. He's hyped up, and nothing beyond
   that.

   There is no nuance, no depth, no variation to his character. Rawley
   will need to change that to make it on SmackDown. Being loud and
   excited will only get him so far.

   y=0&showinfo=0&rel=0&cc_load_policy=0

   After three years, his ring work hasn't evolved much, either.

   He is still raw and limited as a wrestler. Rawley is still doing the
   same rudimentary routine in the ring, unable to tell a story or put on
   a sustained match.

   He's like an NBA player who came into the league only able to block
   shots and who failed to develop a jump shot or any post moves.

   Compare his progression to that of his former NFL teammate and fellow
   SmackDown Superstar, Baron Corbin. The Lone Wolf has grown as a striker
   and storyteller and has continuously expanded his move set. Rawley is
   still just running the ropes and knocking into people.

   It's hard to imagine him earning a lofty spot on the card unless he can
   evolve as a wrestler.


Long-Term Potential

   There isn't a wrestler on the roster with more distance between their
   current status and their ceiling.

   If Rawley picks up the mat game and learns to use all his physical
   gifts, he will be a major player. If he can find ways to add to his
   character and diversify his act, he will go from afterthought to
   contender in a hurry.

   Former NXT creative assistant Rob Naylor noted that Rawley's upside
   lies with him shifting his shtick:

   Should Rawley maximize his talents, he will be a big part of
   SmackDown's future. A midcard title, a brief run as a headliner and a
   vocal fanbase would be in his future.

   The more realistic scenario, though, is that he won't get much better
   than he is right now. Sometimes potential just doesn't turn into
   anything.

   Rawley is likely to remain part of the tag team scene. He and Ryder
   will challenge for the tag team crown a few times, but a failure to win
   the crowd over will prevent them from capturing gold. The Hype Bros
   will remain a novelty act thanks to Rawley's limits.

   The only way to change that trajectory is to evolve in ways Rawley
   failed to do in his three years at NXT.
