Minor Update: Was Sami Zayn Injured Before WWE Raw Match Even Started?

   sami zayn sami zayn WrestlingObserver.com is reporting that Sami Zayn
   may have actually injured himself prior to his match with [15]John Cena
   on WWE Raw last night, and not due to any actual wrestling maneuver
   performed by him or the United States Champion.

   Good catch. If you watch the video below, you can see Sami is fine
   coming down to the ring, not favoring the left arm at all. When he gets
   on the ring steps and tries to hype up the crowd, it appears he may
   have dislocated his shoulder, as he immediately starts stretching out
   the arm.

   Watching the match back again, it’s pretty obvious to me that it was
   the pre-match celebration that did the damage. He’s favoring the
   shoulder from the moment he gets on the steps, as it’s basically limp
   when he steps through the ropes.

   A few minutes later, Cena delivers a back suplex after a rest hold and
   immediately backs off, telling the referee to check on him. At that
   point they bring out the trainer, but it’s clear Cena was aware of the
   injury because there’s virtually no time between hitting the back
   suplex, going for the pin and instructing the referee to check on
   Zayn.

   We’ll know more about the injury later today as Sami will undergo an
   MRI on the shoulder, although WWE will almost certainly play it off as
   an in-ring injury regardless of the actual cause. We will keep you
   updated as more information becomes available.

   Hopefully it was just a stinger, but it looked to me like a
   dislocation. Having dislocated a shoulder and an ankle myself quite a
   few times, I can tell you oftentimes it just takes one motion at just
   the wrong angle to make it happen. And once it happens, if it’s not
   dealt with properly it becomes a lot more likely to happen again. Sami
   just came back from injury on the same shoulder in early April.
