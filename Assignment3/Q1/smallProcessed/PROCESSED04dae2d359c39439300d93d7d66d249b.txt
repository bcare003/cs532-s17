   Where Is Ezekiel Jackson?

      WWE superstar Ezekiel Jackson is having surgery today for two hernias
      he's developed. Jackson posted a recent picture of himself on Instagram
      and explained his recent struggles with staying healthy.

      This will be his third surgery in four years. He has not wrestled a
      match since a WrestleMania 29 Axxess match on April 3rd. Before that,
      he hadn't wrestled since July 3rd of 2012.

      Ezekiel noted that he'll be able to begin training a week in two weeks.
      He's found a new way to train as well since being home, and claims
      he'll be back soon, better than ever.

   WWE High on NXT Star

      WWE officials are very high on NXT superstar Mojo Rawley, reports
      F4WOnline.com. Rawley is someone WWE feels could possibly carry the
      company in the future and it's expected he'll be pushed very strong
      when he's brought up to the main roster.

      Here's a video of Mojo Rawley's NXT debut:
