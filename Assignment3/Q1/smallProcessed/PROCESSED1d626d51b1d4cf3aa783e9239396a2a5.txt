   That collective shriek of joy you’re hearing [16]from the BeyHive?
   [17]Beyoncé and [18]Jay Z are expecting twins.

   Beyoncé, the cultural and music powerhouse, dropped the news in an
   [19]Instagram post on Wednesday afternoon with a picture showing her
   cradling a baby bump:

   [20]We would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed
   two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be
   growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. - The Carters

   A photo posted by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Feb 1, 2017 at 10:39am PST

   The announcement was yet another example of the Beyoncé’s penchant for
   tightly controlling her own narrative. She revealed she was pregnant in
   2011 with [21]a knowing belly rub at the [22]MTV Video Music Awards,
   after a spirited performance of “Love on Top” — and a microphone drop.

   (A quick camera cut to Jay Z, born Shawn Carter, smiling ear-to-ear as
   Kanye West shook his rapper friend by the shoulders confirmed the
   message.)

   Their daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, was born on Jan. 7, 2012.

   While Beyoncé is famously averse to [24]interviews and rarely discusses
   her personal life without setting the terms, she put the spotlight on
   her marriage with the release last year of the album and HBO film[25]
   “Lemonade.”

   It told the story of a struggling relationship, including explicit
   infidelity and, eventually, reconciliation. Many assumed the songs’
   lyrics — which ranged from heartbroken to defiant to forgiving — were
   autobiographical, though the couple never revealed how much of the
   story was based in reality.

   (In her 2013 documentary, “Life Is But a Dream,” Beyoncé discussed
   having an earlier miscarriage. “About two years ago, I was pregnant for
   the first time,” she said. “I flew back to New York to get my checkup —
   and no heartbeat.” Jay Z alluded to the experience in his song
   [27]“Glory.”)

   “Lemonade” is nominated for a leading [28]nine Grammy Awards at the
   ceremony to be held on Feb. 12. Beyoncé is also scheduled to headline
   the second night of the [29]Coachella festival in the California desert
   on April 15 and April 22.

   Things seem to be going well for the couple now — Beyoncé’s Instagram
   post was signed, “The Carters.”

   The pair’s fervent and loyal fans responded with typical enthusiasm to
   the announcement: Twitter said more than half a million tweets were
   sent about the pregnancy within 45 minutes.

   Some Coachella ticket holders wondered about the status of Beyoncé’s
   scheduled performance.

     "Beyoncé. What about Coachella?"

     — Khalil (@kbyrd2) [32]Feb. 1, 2017

   A representative for the singer did not immediately respond to a
   request for comment.

   Jay Z and Beyoncé are not the only musical duo with baby news. Pharrell
   Williams and his wife, Helen Lasichanh, [33]recently welcomed triplets,
   according to reports.
