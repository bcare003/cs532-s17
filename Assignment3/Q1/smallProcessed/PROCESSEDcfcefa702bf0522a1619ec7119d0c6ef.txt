 WWE Raw results: Roman Reigns wins WWE title from Sheamus a day after TLC loss
                          despite Vince McMahon return

   The return of Vince McMahon couldn't prevent Reigns from defeating the
   Celtic Warrior and ending 2015 on the ultimate high

   Reigns2.jpg

   On the heels of a TLC pay-per-view in which Roman Reigns snapped and
   crossed the line by attacking COO Triple H with a steel chair before
   putting him through a table and finishing him off with a massive spear,
   World Wrestling Entertainment hit the USA Network, live from Wells
   Fargo Center in Philadelphia, [125]writes Eric Beaston for Bleacher
   Report.

   How would The Authority address Reigns, and what sanctions or
   repercussions would the juggernaut have to face as he arrived in the
   City of Brotherly Love for Monday's broadcast.

   Speaking of brotherly love, Reigns' closest friend Dean Ambrose
   captured the Intercontinental Championship at TLC, beating Kevin Owens
   to earn his first run with the title he has chased since January. What,
   or, more importantly, who, awaited him as 2015 comes to a close? And
   what did Owens have in store for The Lunatic Fringe just 24 hours after
   his reign came to a crushing conclusion?

Sheamus retains title at TLC as Reigns snaps and attacks Triple H

   Paige, Charlotte and Becky Lynch will be under the same roof for the
   first time since the Divas champion cheated her way to successfully
   retaining her title at TLC. What would The Anti-Diva Paige and
   Charlotte's best friend Lynch have to say about the second-generation
   Diva's recent attitude change?

   And then there's The Wyatt Family, fresh off a clean pay-per-view
   victory. Who would be the unfortunate focus of their attention Monday
   night?

Stephanie McMahon Confronts Roman Reigns

   Stephanie McMahon kicked off the show and was understandably irate
   following the events of TLC.

   She wasted little time calling Roman Reigns to the ring and berating
   him for his actions Sunday night. She referred to him as a disgrace, to
   which Reigns responded by calling The Authority the real disgrace.

   This earned Reigns two slaps to the face and the Billion Dollar
   Princess' announcement that her father, Vince McMahon, will be in the
   arena later Monday night.

Dean Ambrose vs Dolph Ziggler

   The night's opening match featured two of the company's best workers,
   so the fact was it was fun, energetic and a quality bout to boot.

   The Superstars traded control of the bout until Owens hit the ring and
   flattened intercontinental champion Dean Ambrose with his Pop-up
   Powerbomb finisher. Dolph Ziggler, the challenger in the contest,
   attempted to make the save but found himself laid out as well.
   Owens.jpg

   Owens left Ambrose lying in a heap to close out the segment.

R-Truth vs Bo Dallas

   In a match between two guys who have not been relevant in weeks,
   R-Truth battled Bo Dallas in singles competition.

   As Dallas lapped the ring, cameras caught Vince McMahon's arrival to
   the arena, and moments later, the boss made his way to the ring,
   bringing an end to the contest at hand. He ordered the Superstars out
   of the ring and prepared to address the WWE Universe.

   McMahon said someone backstage was sweating and then decided he would
   take a seat at ringside and wait patiently as the show headed to
   commercial break.

Roman Reigns and Vince McMahon Face-to-Face

   Roman Reigns made his way to the ring, confronting WWE's most powerful
   manâ€”Vince McMahon.

   Sheamus interrupted, talked trash about beating Reigns at TLC and then
   suggested a WWE World Heavyweight Championship match for Monday night.
   McMahon.jpg

   McMahon denied the request, telling Reigns that there was no chance in
   hell that he would receive his title opportunity.

   Reigns insulted the boss' "grapefruits," referring to them as prunes,
   which touched a nerve with the Chairman of the Board.

   McMahon granted the match, said if Reigns does not win the title he's
   fired and then finished by delivering a low blow to the company's top
   babyface.

Ryback and Jack Swagger vs Alberto Del Rio and Rusev

   Two midcard feuds took center stage in a big tag team bout pitting The
   League of Nations' Rusev and Alberto Del Rio against Ryback and Jack
   Swagger.

   The match was all Ryback early, with The Big Guy dominating the action
   until Del Rio turned the tide in favour of the heels.
   Rusev-Del-Rio.jpg

   The action broke down late, as is the case with most WWE-style tag
   bouts, and Rusev scored the victory with a big superkick to The
   All-American American.

Neville vs Tyler Breeze

   A rivalry that once played out in the rings of NXT took to the squared
   circle on Raw as Neville battled Tyler Breeze in singles competition.
   The Miz watched from ringside, acting as some sort of Hollywood
   director.

   Neville finished Breeze off with a kick to the face and the Red Arrow,
   just seconds after The Miz yelled "cut" and provided a brief
   distraction.
   Miz.jpg

   After the match, Neville looked on disapprovingly at the Hollywood
   A-lister.

ECW Originals vs The Wyatt Family

   In the continuation of the ECW Originals and The Wyatt Family's feud,
   the two teams met in a Extreme Rules match Monday night.
   Bubba-Ray-Dudley.jpg

   Philadelphia, home to so many epic extreme bouts over the years, bore
   witness to another hardcore brawl between two teams with nothing but
   hatred for each other.

   At one point, it appeared as though The Dudley Boyz were about to
   capture the win following a 3D to Luke Harper through a table, but
   Wyatt pulled the referee out of the ring, breaking up the pinfall.

   Moments later, Erick Rowan splashed Rhyno through a table and scored
   the win for the heels, seemingly bringing a decisive conclusion to
   their feud.
   Erick-Rowan.jpg

The New Day Promo

   One night after retaining their WWE Tag Team Championships against The
   Lucha Dragons and The Usos in a ladder match, The New Day hit the ring
   minus their typical ridiculousness. Kofi Kingston, Big E and Xavier
   Woods spoke sincerely as they relived the match and then called their
   opponents to the ring.
   New-Day1.jpg

   They applauded them and showed humility by shaking their hands and
   crediting the fans with inspiring the six of them to do what they did.

   After the babyfaces left the ring, The New Day celebrated, only to be
   taken down and out by the men they waged war with one night earlier.
   Usos.jpg

Charlotte and Becky Lynch vs Brie Bella and Alicia Fox

   Team B.A.D. watched from ringside, with tickets in their hands, as
   Charlotte and Becky Lynch rekindled their friendship in tag team action
   against Team Bella's Brie Bella and Alicia Fox.

   Ric Flair at ringside and the effect he would have on the outcome of
   the match was the story of the match once more.
   Flair.jpg

   The Nature Boy would make his presence felt late in the bout, hooking
   the foot of Fox as she mounted some offense. This allowed Lynch to lock
   in the Disarmer and score the submission victory, without knowing that
   she had attained the win through nefarious means.

Roman Reigns vs Sheamus

   Roman Reigns' journey to the top of World Wrestling Entertainment
   climaxed Monday night when he defeated Sheamus to capture the World
   Heavyweight Championship.

   Despite Vince McMahon's and The League of Nations' Rusev and Alberto
   Del Rio's attempts to screw him out of the title he has had stolen from
   him so many times here in 2015, he Superman Punched his way to victory
   and delivered a massive spear to end The Celtic Warrior's month-long
   reign.
   Reigns3.jpg

   Fans erupted as the referee's hand slapped the mat for the third time,
   and Lilian Garcia announced the second-generation star as the new
   champion, which is a sharp contrast to the chorus of boos that greeted
   his Royal Rumble victory in the same arena.

   Reigns posed with the title to end the show and ignite a new WWE era.
