Trump and Trudeau on Refugees and Security

   about trade and immigration during a news conference on Monday.

   WASHINGTON — Despite sharp differences on immigration, refugees, trade
   and climate change, President Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
   of [19]Canada struck a cordial tone on Monday in their first meeting,
   alternating between attempting to bridge those gaps and steering clear
   of them.

   Mr. Trump has called for a halt to the admission of refugees, saying
   that terrorists might slip into the United States among them, while Mr.
   Trudeau has held out Canada as a haven for refugees, particularly
   people who have fled the war in Syria, publicly[20] hugging newly
   arrived families.

   When asked at a White House news conference whether he now sees the
   northern American border with Canada as insecure, Mr. Trump skirted the
   question, speaking instead of his administration’s efforts to deport
   criminals from the United States.

   In the same vein, Mr. Trudeau declined to say whether he agreed with
   the president’s [21]executive order restricting immigration.

   “The last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture
   another country on how they choose to govern themselves,” he said.

   Maintaining the country’s close political and economic links with the
   United States was top of the Canadian leader’s agenda before his visit
   to Washington. Mr. Trudeau had forged an unusually close relationship
   with former President Barack Obama, but many of Mr. Trump’s policies,
   particularly his [25]protectionist stance on trade and his call for
   renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, are chilling for
   Canadians. They count on trade with the United States for about 25
   percent of their country’s [26]gross domestic product.

   “It is a real concern for many Canadians because we know that our
   economy is very dependent on our bonds with the United States,” said
   Mr. Trudeau, who has expressed a cautious openness to renegotiating the
   trade pact.

Trump and Trudeau Policy Differences

   President Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada will need
   to work together despite vast differences on climate change, trade and
   migrants.

   Mr. Trump’s complaints about trade have focused primarily on Mexico,
   another partner in the North American agreement, and China, which he
   has accused of taking advantage of the United States. He did not answer
   a question about whether he sees Canada as a fair trader, but suggested
   that he does not foresee deep changes in that relationship, which he
   called “outstanding.”

   “We’ll be tweaking it,” he said. “It’s a much less severe situation
   than what’s taking place on the southern border.”

   He said the two leaders had spoken privately about “doing some
   cross-border things that will make it a lot easier for trade and a lot
   better and a lot faster.” They issued a joint statement pledging to
   continue border security programs that began under Mr. Obama, and
   reaffirming their commitment to NATO, an alliance that Mr. Trump had
   previously questioned.

   In presentation and speech, Mr. Trump, a bombastic Republican, and Mr.
   Trudeau, a more mild-mannered Liberal who is 25 years younger, are
   poles apart. But the prime minister has carefully [31]avoided direct
   criticism of Mr. Trump and his policies. After the American election,
   he reorganized his cabinet to better deal with the change of power in
   Washington and swiftly sent emissaries to meet with Mr. Trump’s
   advisers.

   The meeting was the first test of the Canadian leader’s effort to
   foster a good working relationship.

   Mr. Trump greeted Mr. Trudeau warmly, a reception similar to the
   president’s greeting last week to Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister.
   The leaders shook hands heartily when Mr. Trudeau arrived at the White
   House, patting each other on the shoulder with their free hands.

   Mr. Trudeau appears determined to maintain friendly relations with Mr.
   Trump despite their differences, while signaling to Canadians who are
   wary of their powerful neighbor that Canada still charts its own
   course.

   “We continue our policy of openness to immigration and refugees without
   compromising security,” the prime minister said. “There have been times
   where we have differed in our approaches, and that’s always been done
   firmly and respectfully.”

   Mr. Trudeau presented the president with a framed photograph taken in
   the 1980s, showing Mr. Trump speaking at the head of a table of people
   including Pierre Elliott Trudeau, a former Liberal prime minister of
   Canada and the current prime minister’s father.

   The cabinet ministers who traveled with Mr. Trudeau on Monday had
   prepared for meetings with their American counterparts by emphasizing
   the importance of the cross-border relationship to Canadians. Chrystia
   Freeland, Canada’s foreign minister, had reminded Trump administration
   officials that trade between the countries is roughly in balance, and
   that Canada is the largest buyer of American exports from 35 states.

   “The combination of Canada being smaller and the United States being
   bigger and the relationship largely being trouble-free means a lot of
   Americans don’t spend a lot of time thinking about Canada,” Ms.
   Freeland said in a recent interview. “Americans are not always fully
   aware of the economic significance of the relationship.”

   Canadian business leaders expressed some relief after their prime
   minister’s meeting with Mr. Trump.

   “On the whole, this was a good day,” said John Manley, the president
   and chief executive of the Business Council of Canada, which represents
   150 large Canadian corporations. “There’s still lots of things to be
   anxious about, but I think the tone and the substance were all very
   positive.”

   Some of those anxieties stem from uncertainty over what small changes
   to the United States-Canada trade relationship could mean for some
   sectors of the economy.

   There had been concerns after Mr. Trump’s election that he might go
   after the Canadian auto industry, a major employer in Ontario, which
   exports most of its production to the United States.

   Flavio Volpe, the president of the Auto Parts Manufacturers’
   Association, a trade group, said that it was important for his members
   to hear Mr. Trump’s message that he is not planning to dramatically
   remake the United States’ trade relationship to Canada.

   The two leaders also met on Monday with several women who are chief
   executives of companies from both countries to announce that Canada and
   the United States would set up a cross-border council to advance women
   into executive roles, and to encourage entrepreneurship.

   Richard Pérez-Peña reported from Washington, and Ian Austen from
   Ottawa.
