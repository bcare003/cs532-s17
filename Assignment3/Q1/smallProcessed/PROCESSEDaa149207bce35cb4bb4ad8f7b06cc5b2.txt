Roman Reigns vs. AJ Styles Needs True Heel to Emerge to Elevate WWE's Top
Feud

   WWE will have to turn either Roman Reigns or AJ Styles to create a top
   feud.

   Roman Reigns and [29]AJ Styles have developed WWE's hottest feud over
   the last month. The duo has tremendous chemistry in the ring, evident
   both during WWE Payback and last night on Raw.

   With proper storytelling and character treatment, Reigns and Styles
   could become a top-level feud for a long time. Alexander N. Miller and
   Bleacher Report's Mike Chiari are optimistic:

     Alexander The Great @WWETheAlexander

     This feud between Roman &amp; Co. and the Bullet Club has gotten
     better and better in the past weeks...This is more than heated!

     Mike Chiari @MikeChiari

     What an ending to #WWE #Raw! Love Styles being conflicted. Love
     Reigns flipping out. Such a good, unpredictable angle.
     [31]5/3/2016, 3:09:56 AM

   So far, WWE Creative's got the storytelling down. Now it needs to work
   on the second part of that equation and create a compelling character
   for each. That means someone's got to turn heel. The problem is, it
   doesn't seem that WWE wants to commit to making either Superstar the
   bad guy.

   Not doing so will only hurt this feud and make it less compelling as
   WWE tries to continue to tell a story.


   Reigns, Styles both competing to be babyfaces

   It's understandable why WWE is hesitant to turn either Superstar. In
   Reigns' case, the company has placed so much emphasis on him becoming
   the next big thing. He's become the de facto face of WWE in both
   marketing and promotion—the heir apparent to [32]John Cena in that
   regard.

   The company's top Superstars have all been faces: [33]Hulk Hogan, Stone
   Cold Steve Austin, The Rock and Cena. While each has had runs as a
   heel, all of them were cemented as fan favorites during their time as
   the company's top Superstar.

       for Granted

   For two years Vince McMahon and company have been pushing Reigns down
   that path, and it's difficult to see them changing course, even if the
   entire hardcore fanbase is calling for it to happen. Those fans aren't
   the ones buying Roman Reigns merchandise, which is behind only Cena,
   The Undertaker and Brock Lesnar in the food chain, according to
   Wrestling Observer Newsletter ([34]h/t Brad Davis of SEScoops).

   Styles presents his own problems. First, he's an Internet Wrestling
   Community darling who burst onto the scene since debuting at the Royal
   Rumble.

   Crowd reaction for Styles has been phenomenal (no pun intended).
   On F4WOnline’s Wrestling Observer Radio show, Dave Meltzer noted "AJ
   Styles has gotten a better reaction than Dean Ambrose; than Roman
   Reigns; than anyone" on the road ([35]h/t Rob Leigh of TalkSport).

   Second, he's played the hero since entering the company only a short
   time ago. Feuds and interactions with the likes of Chris Jericho, Kevin
   Owens and The Miz have illustrated Styles' good-guy persona, something
   the company should be leery of casting aside so soon into his WWE run.


   Guilt by association: Heels through their friends' actions

   If WWE is going to make either man a heel, it's likely to come through
   a third-party affiliation. On Monday, The Usos, along with Doc Gallows
   and Karl Anderson, were those conduits, causing both Reigns and Styles
   to inch closer to dark territory. Kyle Lewis and SiriusXM Busted Open
   commented on Styles situation:

     Kyle Lewis @KeepItFiveStar

     AJ Styles is like that good kid hanging out with his bad cousins.
     #6ManTag #RAW
     [36]5/3/2016, 3:06:13 AM

     SiriusXM Busted Open @BustedOpenRadio

     AJ Styles is an honorable man. The Usos, however, are huge jerks.
     #6ManTag #RAW
     [37]5/3/2016, 3:06:40 AM

   Both men moved the needle toward heel behavior—Styles with chair shots
   to the Usos and Reigns with a powerbomb through the announce table. Of
   course, WWE had its cake and ate it too: Reigns wasn't aware Styles
   declined an open-chair shot to the champion. He only saw the attack on
   the Usos. Family is family, after all.

   It's been the same story since Gallows and Anderson attacked Reigns on
   Raw two weeks prior to WWE Payback. Styles intervenes on the champion's
   behalf, although the champ doesn't see the good deed. That opens up
   Reigns to viciousness, which is mistaken by some fans as a heel turn.
   WWE Universe described what happened to Styles following his attack on
   the Usos, which Reigns described as basically a no-brainer situation
   resulting from an attack on "The Family":

     WWE Universe @WWEUniverse

     Crashing through the announce table goes @AJStylesOrg after he used
     the steel chair on the @WWEUsos! #RAW https://t.co/1F3HkWRMd8
     [38]5/3/2016, 3:08:28 AM

     Roman Reigns @WWERomanReigns

     I'd take a bullet for @WWEUsos any day. I told you, don't mess with
     The Family! #TableBomb #Raw
     [39]5/3/2016, 4:27:48 AM

   Some fans applaud this from Reigns, thinking it's the start of
   something more.

   Don't be fooled. In WWE Creative's eyes, every move Reigns makes is
   justified, therefore he isn't a heel. Every Fabulous Forearm Styles
   delivers to Reigns is a defensive move, since Reigns attacks first.
   Eventually someone's going to have to strike first, and it's a decision
   WWE is afraid to make.

   Every great feud has a protagonist and antagonist. The current
   Reigns-Styles feud is missing that one crucial element: a leading
   character.

   Without it, their feud can't move forward. It remains stuck in neutral.
   Sure, there can be conflict resulting in good matches, maybe even great
   ones. But even Ryback and Kalisto had a great match at WWE Payback— one
   that won't be remembered because there was no story behind it.

   Without someone to root for, WWE risks losing control of the very
   powerful narrative it's created. To delay a decision past Extreme
   Rules—more than two months past this feud's genesis—is to admit neither
   Reigns nor Styles is as bad, or as good, as WWE needs each wrestler to
   be.
