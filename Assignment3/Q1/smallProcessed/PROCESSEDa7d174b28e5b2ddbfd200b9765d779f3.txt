Historian Abby Smith Rumsey on how digital memory shapes the future

As electronic records replace physical ones, how do we make sure we don’t
overwrite our history?

   Historian and archivist Abby Smith Rumsey has long been fascinated by
   the way information technology shapes our collective memory and
   perceptions of history. Trained as a Russian scholar, she’s worked in
   Soviet-era archives and spent a decade at the Library of Congress.

   In her new book, When We Are No More: How Digital Memory is Shaping Our
   Future, Rumsey explains that the Internet is not a stable archive like
   a library. Rather, it is a bulletin board, constantly being rewritten
   without a record. This can have far-reaching implications when so much
   progress humans make relies on what we remember and have recorded from
   previous eras. What happens to human progress as our methods of
   record-keeping become ever more vulnerable?

   In an interview with Slack, Rumsey explains why sorting and organizing
   data, not simply storing it, should guide our digital practices, and
   how digital record-keeping is essential to the health and progress of
   humanity.

   Slack: You note that in the past, when humans wanted to preserve
   culture for future generations, we invented tools, such as the printing
   press, or storage, such as libraries. Why hasn’t our ability to
   preserve digital data caught up with our ability to produce it?

   Rumsey: We generate almost unimaginable volumes of digital data,
   between the exabytes of data streaming down from deep space probes,
   weather satellites (and who knows how much from spy satellites), to the
   mapping of the human genome. Science is data-intensive. But so are
   preteens with smartphones who send tens of thousands of messages and
   photos — some they create, others they resend. A gigabyte here, and
   zettabyte there, pretty soon you’re talking real scale.

   But volume is only a problem if you want to keep more data than you
   have storage for. The default mode of good memory is not “everything.”
   It is “everything we will need and want to know in the future.” We
   haven’t saved every single TV news broadcast, every radio program,
   every photograph ever taken, every office memo or scrap of paper with a
   grocery list on it. Not being able to throw away ephemera is diagnosed
   as an illness!

   The problem today is that digital is new. We’re just beginning to
   understand what may have long-term value and what won’t. That’s
   natural, if regrettable. Eighty percent of all silent films are lost
   because people thought they were just ephemeral commercial products
   with no intrinsic cultural or informational value.

     We need more storage, yes, but more important is developing better
     ways to organize and search what we have and letting redundant
     texts, emails, photos go.

   Slack: You laud the partnership in which Twitter donates its archive to
   the Library of Congress for preservation. What other types of
   partnerships for maintaining digital data do you envision for the
   future?

   Rumsey: It is sobering to think about how dependent the average
   Internet user is on “free” platforms for mail, messaging,
   instagramming, snapchatting, tweeting, photo sharing, uploading videos,
   downloading shared work files. These platforms are all privately owned.
   That means the companies have ultimate control over the long-term fate
   of all those data — our personal data, in many cases.

   Future access to our own history depends on actions taken today to
   preserve and maintain information. That requires organizations that are
   accountable to the public and that last for centuries. Think archives,
   not MySpace, wherever that is today. The commercial satellites our
   government relies on for GPS, the creative content companies who
   license — not sell — music to us, the sites that publish e-only
   content — all should partner with an archive to ensure long-term access
   to valuable cultural, scientific, and government data after the
   companies go out of business or discard data that no longer turns a
   profit for them.

   Slack: If we lose the ability to access memories made in the digital
   era, how might this impact human progress in the future?

   Rumsey: Memory is the way the brain accumulates knowledge of the world
   and of ourselves. All creatures, from amoeba to zebra, rely on the
   working model of the world stored in their memory banks. Wipe those
   memories out, induce amnesia in us, and we won’t remember who we are,
   where we are, what just happened.

   Humans have created a uniquely powerful supplement to natural
   memory — the ability to record knowledge on durable physical objects
   and use in the future, be it a clay tablet or a printed page. Wipe out
   the digital data that encodes the locations of toxic waste, the
   contents of IRS records, or the service records of veterans, we would
   find navigating the present so fraught with distress and danger that
   investment in the future would be a luxury we couldn’t afford, the
   notion of progress a cruel joke.
