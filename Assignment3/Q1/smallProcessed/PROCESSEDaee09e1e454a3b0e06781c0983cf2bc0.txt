   Lost in the excitement and outrage of Donald Trump’s first three weeks
   as president of the United States was a minor sartorial scandal: The
   putative leader of the free world cannot tie a necktie properly.
   Compared with religious persecution at our borders and the unraveling
   of decades-old international alliances, this may seem trivial. But
   could a misbegotten (and far too shiny) necktie reflect weightier
   issues of self-discipline, competence and integrity?

   One should fasten a necktie so that the front falls just at the waist,
   then thread the narrow end through the loop on the back of the front
   one to keep it in place. But the president makes the front end much too
   long — it hangs far below his waistline — while the narrower end sits,
   stubby and forlorn, only inches below his collar. As a consequence, the
   too-short, narrower end cannot reach the loop on the overlong wider
   end, and the two threaten to go off in separate directions, like
   cabinet members with competing agendas.

   To compensate, the president resorts to a kludge favored by 8-year-olds
   forced to dress up for a wedding: Scotch tape. [15]Close-up photos from
   two occasions — one taken during the inauguration! — clearly show a
   strip of cellophane tape holding the errant tie end in place.

   For men of a certain age, learning to tie a tie was a rite of passage.
   The necktie is a sign of maturity, self-discipline and respect for
   tradition. The knot in one’s necktie is a biography in silk,
   communicating details of temperament, character and upbringing. Bulky
   Double Windsors are brash and extroverted. Perfectly symmetrical knots
   with centered dimples betray an obsessive-compulsive personality. The
   Italians have mastered the insouciance of the slightly off-center knot
   — some even leave the narrower end a bit longer, letting it peek out
   from behind the thicker one in front, as if to say, I really couldn’t
   be bothered to redo it.

   Trump partisans may well complain: Why is the Italian imperfect
   tie-knot considered chic and the presidential idiosyncrasy déclassé?
   Isn’t this a double standard set up by liberal elitists?

   As with most sartorial conventions, there is an underlying logic. The
   long, fat end of Mr. Trump’s tie, flapping in the breeze like an
   advertising banner or swinging far beneath his belt, is both overly
   contrived and disproportionate. By contrast, the Italian’s slightly
   askew tie is visually balanced and charmingly unselfconscious. If the
   Italian’s tie shows an aristocratic disdain for the trappings of
   masculine potency, Mr. Trump’s symmetrical but overlong tie stands out
   like a rehearsed macho boast, crass and overcompensating. In past eras
   such posturing could be unlawful: The overstuffing of one’s codpiece,
   for instance, was considered such an affront to public order in
   Renaissance England that offenders were forced to march through the
   streets with their stuffing pulled out — their deception exposed for
   all to see.

   And then there is the matter of the tape. This is the opposite of the
   Italian’s devil-may-care. It betrays a devil who cares too much — and
   about the wrong things. Whereas the slightly imperfect tie knot
   demonstrates nonchalance, the badly tied and taped tie suggests a
   desperate but failed bid to look “correct.” It’s not only a failure,
   but also a fraud, a paper moon artlessly stuck over a cardboard sea.

   Mr. Trump’s neckties tell us something about his social and political
   ties. He has made the persona of the loud, tacky mogul a sort of
   trademark. Many of his supporters cheer him on because of his lack of
   refinement — they consider him a refreshing change from patrician
   politicians born with a silver tie bar clutched in their long elegant
   fingers. Mr. Trump comes off as a plebeian hero in spite of his
   inherited wealth because he did not inherit the sensibilities of the
   elite. He may have grown up in a plutocrat’s manor, but he was not to
   the manner born.

   Mr. Trump’s tie symbolizes one of the central questions of his
   candidacy, and now his presidency. Is his seeming ineptness genuine? Or
   is it part of a contrived performance, designed to deploy the symbols
   of power while rejecting the conventions of civility that have
   traditionally defined and constrained them?

   Richard Thompson Ford teaches at Stanford Law School and is writing a
   book about dress codes.
