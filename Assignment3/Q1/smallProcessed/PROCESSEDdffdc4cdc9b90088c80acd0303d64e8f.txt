Exploring the Fashion-Focused on Twitter [Infographic]

   February 16, 2017 [82]Andrew Hutchinson

   Twitter has released a [83]new infographic which outlines the findings
   of their latest research into the fashion-focused audience on the
   platform.

   As part of the lead up to London Fashion Week (17^th to 21^st
   February), Twitter [84]commissioned Nielsen to get an overview of the
   fashion-related interests and behaviors of Twitter users.

   Their research showed that:
     * 76% of Twitter users are interested in fashion and fashion trends
     * 43% of users look to influencers - such as models and designers -
       for fashion inspiration on the platform
     * Twitter users are 75% more likely than non-users to buy clothes
       that are on trend

   Those are some pretty compelling stats – while most would associate
   visual-focused platforms like Pinterest and Instagram with [85]fashion
   trends, the data here would suggest that Twitter should also be a key
   consideration for fashion brands.

   You can check out the full Twitter [86]#Fashion2017 infographic below.
