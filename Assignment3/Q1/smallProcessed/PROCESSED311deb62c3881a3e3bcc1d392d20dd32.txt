   Recording Artist
   Having appeared as a featured artist on records with Usher, T.I.,
   Jermaine Dupri, Jamie Foxx, Rich Boy and Fat Joe, Love released the
   acclaimed “Discrete Luxury” EP, his first work as a solo recording
   artist in 2013. The lead single “They Don’t’ Know” was called “one of
   the hottest songs on the radio right now” by Vibe magazine and reached
   #4 on Billboard’s Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop chart. His second single
   “Bitches Be Like” released in early 2014. A “smash hit” according to
   XXL magazine, the track received heavy rotation by leading digital
   broadcasters Sirius XM radio and Music Choice. Following summer 2014’s
   “Honest Tour,” Love released “He Got Money” featuring tour headliner,
   Future. The track was taken from Love’s LP, “I SIN,” released August,
   2014. In late 2014, he released “Somebody Else,” the lead single from
   his forthcoming LP. The single is available now for download and Rico’s
   debut album, TURN THE LIGHTS ON, will be released on May 19th through
   his own label, Division 1, a partnership with Interscope Records.
