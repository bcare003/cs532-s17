Dean Ambrose doesn't want to connect with you on Twitter or Facebook

   [31]New, [32]42 comments

The Shield star has an interesting viewpoint on social media, one you might
appreciate or strongly disagree with.

   Considering the emphasis the powers that be place within WWE place on
   social media, it's somewhat surprising that top stars within the
   promotion aren't as active on Facebook and Twitter. Oh sure, you've got
   your John Cena motivational tweets mixed with storyline bits, or your
   cryptic Bray Wyatt updates, but then you've got Dean Ambrose.

   If you look at [39]his Twitter account, you'll see that he has 115,361
   followers (as of this writing, at least), he isn't following anyone
   himself, and he's only tweeted three times. His timeline, however,
   reveals a simple retweet from all the way back in March 2012:

     [40]@TheDeanAmbrose red plaid shirt, whiskey sours, breaking bad
     — Don Desh (@vitaminDwrestle) [41]March 23, 2012

   That's it.

   His Facebook page has just over 15,000 "likes" but it's clear he's not
   running it and may not even have any idea it exists. There's a reason
   for that, too, and his explanation for it is as interesting as the man
   himself.

   From [42]his interview with The Reminder:

     "I probably don't have any more of a bigger following on the
     Internet than anybody else does, I just probably have a stranger
     one. I don't know where that comes from. Maybe it's just the kind of
     person I attract. I'm aware that that's there, but I try to not pay
     too close attention to it, unless for simple entertainment purposes.
     As far as social media and all that, I understand connecting with
     fans on a different level, but I don't feel the need to open myself
     up to the opinion of everybody in the world with a phone or
     computer. I just don't get that; being connected to everybody on
     such a superficial level like that. It's not really for me.

     "There's a kind of mystery when you don't put yourself out like
     that. When you don't put yourself out like that, people start to
     kind of create their own version of you in their head of what you
     really are like or who you really are and things about you become
     rumors and all that becomes true. People's perception of me they
     haven't even realized is probably so, or it might be kind of real,
     but maybe they know but [maybe] they don't. No one really has any
     idea about me. To me, what I give you is what happens onscreen and
     past that, anything you're coming up with in your own head you're
     creating in your own mind. But it's cool. I'd rather have too many
     weird fans than no fans at all. I love all those crazy girls."

   There is so much more to the full interview I strongly encourage you go

   your thoughts on Ambrose's comments here.
