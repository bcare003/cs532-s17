Roman Reigns vs. Braun Strowman: Early Hits and Misses from WWE Raw Feud

Roman Reigns vs. Braun Strowman: Early Hits and Misses from WWE Raw Feud

   1 of 5

       Roman Reigns vs. [29]Braun Strowman is the WWE Raw equivalent of a
       shoot-em-up movie—a straight-forward story fueled by aggression and
       adrenaline.
       Reigns wants to chop down the redwood of a man after Strowman
       denied him a shot at the Universal Championship. Strowman is angry
       at The Big Dog for daring to step up to him. Violence has ensued,
       erupting in a number of arenas as WWE marches toward the Fastlane
       pay-per-view on March 5.
       For the most part, the pairing of powerhouses has
       clicked. Strowman's hot streak and Reigns' prominent position has
       made for a winning combination.
       The rivalry's issues mostly lie in big-picture elements. The PPV
       schedule has the rivals hurrying into battle, and Reigns playing
       anything other than a smarmy, condescending and merciless heel is
       the wrong move.
       The following is a dive into their feud thus far, breaking down
       what's working and what's not.

Hit: Eye for an Eye

   2 of 5

       Strowman vs. Reigns' central theme of retaliation has resonated.
       One attack has led to another to create a circle of payback. Each
       attack is the feud's next logical step.
       It began in earnest on the Jan. 2 Raw when Reigns and Goldberg
       flattened Strowman with spears in stereo. The Monster Among Men
       responded at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view with a beatdown that
       prevented Reigns from winning the Universal Championship.
       Reigns spoiled Strowman's title match against Owens soon after. The
       former member of The Wyatt Family then hunted down The Big Dog
       during his bout with Samoa Joe on Feb. 6.
       The simplicity of the narrative has been its biggest strength.
       There have been no long-winded promos or convoluted explanations.
       Instead, these are simply two angry titans who feel wronged. Their
       back-and-forth violence has compelled audiences thus far.

Miss: Fastlane in the Way

       WWE may be planning to continue Reigns vs. Strowman into
       WrestleMania 33 and beyond, but many expect Reigns to take on
       Undertaker instead. Their confrontation at the Royal Rumble felt
       like a heavy-handed tease of that showdown.
       If that's how things unfold, the company will have to push Strowman
       aside and leave this story unfinished.
       If WWE is instead planning on pitting The Monster Among Men against
       Reigns at WrestleMania, getting it early at Fastlane will ruin the
       special feeling of the match. It will be a sequel rather than an
       original.
       And there isn't sufficient time to let the bad blood between these
       warriors simmer. The calendar is forcing things to move quickly.

Hit: A Monster's Momentum

       Strowman will head into Fastlane as one of WWE's biggest success
       stories of late. The big man has emerged as a potential top-tier
       star, thanks in large part to the company committing to him and
       presenting him as an apex predator gobbling up much of the food
       chain.
       Recent images of his dominance still linger.
       Strowman steamrolled the competition in the Royal Rumble,
       ousting six men from the match, including hosses Big Cass, Big Show
       and Mark Henry, per [32]WWE.com. Victory is commonplace for him,
       and when he doesn't win, his matches have ended in no-contests or
       disqualifications.
       WWE has done well to protect him, using strong booking to propel
       him.
       That continued on the Feb. 6 Raw when Strowman devoured four
       jobbers at once. The sight of him pinning a pile of flesh was a
       powerful one.
       [33]Kyle Fowle of The A.V. Club wrote of the latest squash match,
       "It's a good way to keep Braun at his current level without getting
       stale, especially when you add in the brutal beating he lays on
       Reigns at the end of the episode."
       The momentum Strowman has built elevates his clash with Reigns.
       It's a big deal if Reigns beats the monster at this point. And
       considering Strowman's recent past, the audience isn't sure if
       he'll go down, even if Reigns is treated like the Superman of the
       squared circle.

Miss: Reigns Remains Miscast

       A tale of a hero looking to conquer a villain is askew.
       WWE wants to sell us on the idea of Reigns as a babyface, but too
       much of the crowd wants no part of that. As a result, the crowd
       reactions for this feud have been out of whack.
       When Strowman crushed Reigns' title dreams at the Royal Rumble, the
       audience chanted, "Thank you, Roman!" Strowman earned cheers when
       he beat down Reigns in his match with The Samoan Submission
       Machine, too.
       Philly.com's Vaughn Johnson [35]joked on Twitter, "Braun Strowman
       slowly becoming a babyface every time he thwarts Roman Reigns."
       A double turn would be an excellent move. History says, though, WWE
       isn't thinking that way. It has been dead set on making Reigns its
       top babyface, even if the audience soundly rejects the idea.
       That has hampered the Strowman feud.
       It's hard to buy into Reigns as a conquering warrior while jeers
       remain his soundtrack. It's hard to root against Strowman when he
       comes off as the violent representation of the anti-Reigns brigade.
