Who pooped on this Chicago man's Tesla?

   When Karl Marx wrote about the proletariat rising up against the ruling
   class in the 1800s, he had no idea what luxury, electric-powered cars
   were and he also had no idea the revolution would start with someone
   landing a hot dookie on a man’s [8]Tesla Model X in Lakeview. Viva the
   revolpooption! Robin Hood? More like someone who might be named Robin
   just let one loose on a the hood of a man’s car? (I’m so sorry).

   According to [9]a hilarious Craigslist I hope isn’t fake but probably
   is, Michael, the owner of said Tesla, is not happy at all, writing, "I
   am seeking people out here to see if anyone has any information about
   who may have taken a gigantic shit on the windshield of my brand new
   Tesla Model X,” before adding, “this is not a joke.” As his post
   recounts, the fecal incident happened near Stratford Place and
   Broadway, where his car was parked.

   Following a "third date" with a woman "who was very conservative" at
   Lakeview bar Rocks, Michael found "two sizable logs and smaller ball
   which rolled down to my wipers." "Pee was not visible leading me to
   believe that *perhaps* someone had shit in a container at home and then
   threw it on my car later," Michael speculates. The post continues, "I
   had to use a redeye magazine and a bottle of water to clean it off and
   that sucked.” Which, well, screw you buddy, this paper is for reading.
   We were on your side! (But really, good on you for getting a second use
   out of newsprint.)

   "Taking dumps on a person's car is something children do, not adults,"
   Michael claims in the post, which makes me think we had wholly
   different childhoods. In his defense though, such a messy discovery is
   pretty shocking. Michael admits as much, "Now I know a lot of people
   might find this funny [Editor's note: It truly, truly is] but my date
   was really traumatized by the whole thing and I have zero leads."

   If anyone has good enough info on the poo poo platter left on Michael's
   car, he's willing to offer a reward, explaining, "I am not going to
   mention dollar amounts here but I work in [10]the medical community and
   trust me when I say I think the amount I have in mind will not
   disappoint. After all, I do own a Tesla" (hyperlink added by RedEye).
   As if anyone was starting to feel bad for the guy, he adds, "I am so
   greatly saddened this city has been over run by thugs and poor people
   who are having too many children. I cannot be surprised that Donald
   Trump is doing so well when I see my car had someone shit or toss shit
   on it in clear view of the public."

   Actually, with that kind of attitude maybe more people should go colon
   bowling on this guy's car. Just my take here. [11]Read the entire post

   RedEye has reached out to Michael for comment. As of press time, he has
   not responded which makes us believe that this post, while hilarious,
   stinks as much as the fictional number two dropped on his fake Tesla's
   not-real windshield.
