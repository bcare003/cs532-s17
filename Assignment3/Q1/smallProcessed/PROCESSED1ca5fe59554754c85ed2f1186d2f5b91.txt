LeBron James goes off on Charles Barkley, questions his credibility

LeBron James goes off on Charles Barkley, questions his credibility

Oh, and he brought up the baggage from the former All-Star's playing days in
a big way

   LeBron James has apparently had enough.

   For years, Charles Barkley has spoken his mind about various players
   and issues on Inside the [102]NBA. Barkley's brash and unapologetic
   opinions have driven ratings and are part of what makes the show
   entertaining, along with the balance that Kenny Smith and, in recent
   years, Shaquille O'Neal provide alongside host Ernie Johnson.

   But after Barkley once again took James to task regarding his recent
   spat with Cavs management about the roster, James apparently had enough
   on Monday following the Cavs' loss to Dallas. He fired back at Barkley,
   and he did not bring a squirt gun.

     "He's a hater," James told ESPN of Barkley following the Cleveland
     Cavaliers' 104-97 loss to the Dallas Mavericks on Monday. "What
     makes what he says credible? Because he's on TV?"

     Barkley has consistently needled James, telling HBO's Bill Simmons
     last summer James would "never" ascend to top-five status in NBA
     history over Michael Jordan, Oscar Robertson, Bill Russell, Kareem
     Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain and going back all the way to "The
     Decision" television special when Barkley told ESPN Radio 103.3 FM
     in Dallas/Fort Worth it was a "punk move."

     James initially took the high road when asked about Barkley's recent
     comments, saying they were "good for the ratings" while defending
     his competitive spirit.

     But after an ESPN followed up with a story asking Tristan Thompson
     for his thoughts on Barkley's comments, James chose to speak out
     again in ardent fashion.

     "I'm not going to let him disrespect my legacy like that," James
     told ESPN. "I'm not the one who threw somebody through a window. I
     never spit on a kid. I never had unpaid debt in Las Vegas. I never
     said, 'I'm not a role model.' I never showed up to All-Star Weekend
     on Sunday because I was in Vegas all weekend partying."All I've done
     for my entire career is represent the NBA the right way. Fourteen
     years, never got in trouble. Respected the game. Print that."

     "Go watch the '93 Finals when John Paxson hit the shot," James said.
     "Barkley and Jordan were laughing and joking with each other during
     one of the games while somebody's shooting a free throw. In the
     Finals. But, oh, nobody were friends back then."

   Source: [103]LeBron James of Cleveland Cavaliers throws down gauntlet
   -- Charles Barkley 'a hater'.

   In case you were wondering:

   The Wynn in [104]Las Vegas sued Barkley for $400,000 for unpaid debts.

   Barkley famously said [105]"I'm not a role model" in a Nike ad.

   Barkley did, in fact, [106]throw a man through a window in 1997 and
   wasn't even apologetic about it.

   So, yeah.

   This is what happens when you provoke the best player of his generation
   who also happens to have an eidetic memory.

   Later Monday night, James tweeted:

     Sometimes I gotta just make sure that i didn't lose you. Did I?!?!
     Did I?!?! Did I Lose You
     — LeBron James (@KingJames) [107]January 31, 2017

   James isn't wrong here -- all of what he referred to were facts. But it
   does say something that James seems so emotionally volatile. He's
   clearly frustrated with the Cavs about their decision not to retain
   Matthew Dellavedova or replace him with another backup point guard, as
   well as how they've left themselves short on rim protectors. He
   referenced as [108]much on Sunday when talking about Tristan Thompson.

   James seems to do this every January -- going through a seasonal
   downturn where he stews over the grind of the season. Maybe he does it
   to entertain himself in the NBA's long, boring middle stretch. Maybe he
   genuinely is feeling stressed out watching the Warriors get better and
   better. Maybe he just decided that after bringing the Cavaliers back
   from down 3-1 with one of the greatest Finals performance of all time
   and delivering Cleveland its first major professional sports title
   since 1964, he has earned the right not to have to take pot shots every
   week from a former player who was never a great defender on the most
   popular studio show in the sport.

   You can bet Barkley will be asked about this on radio shows and will
   address the matter on the Thursday edition of Inside the NBA on TNT.
   This story is by no means over.
