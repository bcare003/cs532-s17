Projecting What's Next for Triple H, Samoa Joe After Seth Rollins' Injury

   Credit: WWE.com
   [28]Tom ClarkFeatured ColumnistFebruary 5, 2017

   [29]Triple H once again lived up to his Cerebral Assassin moniker when
   he used Samoa Joe as a weapon against Seth Rollins. The Architect had
   been biding his time on WWE Raw, waiting for The Game to finally show
   his face.

   But The King of Kings did not come alone.

   However, Rollins is now out injured, so an immediate match between him
   and Triple H or Samoa Joe is likely not possible. With one of WWE's top
   guys once again missing in action, fans are wondering where Triple H
   and The Samoan Submission Machine go from here.

   The pairing is perfect on paper.

   Joe needed a way on to the main roster, and Triple H was it. Fans had
   been waiting for to see him on Raw, and now, the former NXT champion is
   where he belongs. There were many fans who wondered why Joe was not
   directly sent to the main roster when he first came to WWE in 2015, but
   his time in NXT allowed him to build a connection.

   That established him as one of the company's toughest men. Now, WWE
   fans know what the rest of the world already did: Samoa Joe is a star.

   Of all the guys Triple H has taken under his wing, Joe is perhaps the
   most violent. Batista was The Animal. [31]Randy Orton is The Viper.
   Rollins is The Man. But Samoa Joe is The Destroyer. He is nothing but
   rage and intensity. There's no grace or subtlety in his soul. There is
   only malice.

   Joe is all business, and he has the boss in his corner. But is that the
   storyline WWE will explore?


The Boss and the Enforcer

   Joe is a veteran of the business, and at one time, a showdown between
   him and Triple H was on many fans' short lists of must-book matches.
   The Game has 25 years of experience in the industry, and Joe has 18.
   Both men have worked all over the world, and they have the respect of
   their peers and the fans alike.

   Triple H would not exactly be a mentor; Joe's ready.

   Joe would perhaps be more of an enforcer for Triple H, as The Shield
   was at one time. Triple H's corporate role has taken him out of the
   ring for the most part, so using Joe as his assassin is the best way to
   go.

   Joe would be the ammo, but Triple H would be the man pointing the gun.

   If WWE does pursue that idea, then Joe could go head-to-head with Kevin
   Owens. Without Triple H's assist in August 2016, Owens would likely not
   have won the Universal Championship. That was the night when KO
   replaced Rollins as the man who had Triple H's blessing to lead Raw.

   So even though Joe may not be Triple H's newest project, he could still
   cross paths with Owens. Joe could remind Owens that he would not be
   champion without Triple H. That could lead to a feud that would see Joe
   emerge as a main event player on Raw.

   The complexion of Monday nights would change, as Rollins would be on
   the shelf while Joe becomes the man.


The Authority or The Big Dog?

   If Joe becomes the new top guy, then The Authority could once again be
   established on Raw. Stephanie McMahon has been preoccupied as the Raw
   commissioner and has left The Authority behind. One storyline could
   lead back to another, and that would mean the return of WWE's most
   hated corporate faction.

   However, that's an outcome many fans want nothing to do with.

   Going back to The Authority angle would be too predictable, but using
   Joe as the spoiler for anyone who defied the McMahons would not. So the
   enforcer role would suit Raw's newest star.

   But then there's always the possibility that Joe could venture out on
   his own and challenge Raw's other Samoan heavy hitter, Roman Reigns,
   who will probably be one of the first to voice his displeasure about
   Rollins' injury, giving him automatic heat with Joe.

   Reigns vs. The Undertaker was teased during the Royal Rumble match, but
   there's been no progress on that storyline. Samoa Joe vs. The
   Undertaker is another dream match, but it may not be meant to happen.

   Reigns vs. Joe, however, would introduce a new rivalry that could
   dominate the company leading to WrestleMania 33. If WWE is interested
   in booking for the future, then Samoa Joe vs. Roman Reigns would be a
   great way to do it.

   That doesn't answer the question of which Superstar Triple H could work
   with at WrestleMania, though the field is open for him. The Game has
   nothing left to prove and doesn't need to reach the main event level.
   However, that's not true of Joe, who needs smart booking moving forward
   if he is to succeed on the main roster.

   The benefit of using Joe is that he can do anything. He could become
   the most hated heel on Raw and believably demolish anyone who gets in
   his way. Or he could turn babyface at some point and become the most
   popular Superstar on Monday nights.

   Regardless of the direction WWE wants to go in, Samoa Joe will be
   ready. He's been ready for a long time.
