[49]The Rock Shares A Story About WWE Universal Champion Kevin Owens

   – WWE Universal Champion Kevin Owens visited [52]The Rock while
   backstage at Monday’s RAW in Los Angeles. The Rock wrote the following
   on Instagram about Owens and tells a story from when he was training
   with [53]Curtis Axel and Curt Hawkins:

   Appreciate The Champ himself, Kevin Owens stopping by “The People’s
   Hood” to say hello. People’s Hood is the nickname for my dressing
   rooms.

   We had a good laugh about the story of when I was training for my WWE
   comeback and title run (2012) I was training with Kurt Hawkins and Joe
   Hennig. After our workout, me and Kurt were chopping it up about great
   independent wrestlers. I said “Dude I just saw this guy last night on
   YouTube named Kill Steen or something like that. He’s amazing.” Kurt
   said, “That’s my good friend Kevin Owens”. I said “We’ll tell your
   friend he’s bad ass and I hope WWE signs him.” Now 5yrs later and
   relentless hard work, he’s WWE Universal Champion. I like when good
   things happen to good hard working people.

   He’s an asshole though for growing a better beard than I can.
