   Like almost every wrestling fan you talk to these days, I love me some
   Dean Ambrose. After I became a wrestling fan back in April, it didn‚Äôt
   take me long to find out what a Dean Ambrose Girl was or that I pretty
   much was one.

   But the more I watch, the more I have to be honest with myself about
   why I love watching this guy. Early on, I would have said he was my
   "wrestling crush" ‚Äì after all, here‚Äôs an attractive man on television
   doing stuff, and here I am hanging on his every word, gazing at every
   punch and kick. It must be celebrity-love‚Ä¶ right?

   Ambrose is 28 and I‚Äôm, well, not 28 anymore (let‚Äôs call it mid-30s and
   leave it at that, shall we?), so it seemed a little embarrassing to
   find myself fan-girling it up with a group that trends a good 15 years
   younger than I am. But as much as that might have embarrassed me, it
   actually drew me up short when I realized that the real reason I feel
   so drawn to him is not a crush ‚Äì it‚Äôs because I identify with him.

   Yep. Let that sink in, 30-something single career woman. You identify
   with a pro-wrestler whose gimmick is mental instability.

   Once it all started making sense, though, it helped me realize why
   Ambrose is such a draw for me, and it helped me enjoy watching him that
   much more.

   He talks about his feelings.

   Looking back over Dean‚Äôs time with the Shield, and most especially in
   his couple of months as a singles competitor, this is a character that
   doesn‚Äôt just go to tough-guy chatter or cheesy jokes to intimidate his
   foes. He simply tells the camera, the interviewer, his Shield partners
   ‚Äì whomever he‚Äôs speaking to ‚Äì what‚Äôs going on with him.

   During the Shield‚Äôs feud with Evolution, I recall him describing
   something Evolution had done to Seth and Roman and then yelling, "I
   don‚Äôt like how they make me feel!" In another good example, when he
   finally got in the ring against Seth (well, and Kane, but it was really
   about Seth) during a recent Smackdown, he threw his former friend into
   the corner, punching him, yelling, "I loved you, Seth! You were my
   brother!" Yep, putting it right out there. He has feelings! He will
   express them! Heart on his sleeve ‚Äì he simply shows people who he is.

   I can relate to this impulse. Sometimes I follow through on it, and
   other times I clam up. But I always admire people who can just say what
   they think and feel without hesitation.

   He doesn‚Äôt let go of anything.

   Okay, so, when it‚Äôs a deadly grudge against his sworn enemy, it‚Äôs maybe
   not the healthiest trait. But this‚Ä¶ I get this. What I understand and
   admire about it is the bone-deep level of commitment. This isn‚Äôt a
   decision ‚Äì "Well, I should really haunt Seth Rollins now," or "I‚Äôm
   getting tired of vengeance, but I should press on with it" ‚Äì it‚Äôs a
   state of being. When you feel things that deeply, to where they just
   don‚Äôt go away and you don‚Äôt change your mind about them, it‚Äôs like
   having a nuclear power source that you can use for good or for evil.

   Happily, I have never been in a blood feud. Or even a pro-wrestling
   feud. But I know what it‚Äôs like to have my mind so obstinately made up
   that even when I stand back from the situation and think about whether
   I should change it, I feel like it‚Äôs impossible to do so. I utterly and
   completely "get" the depth of emotion behind the Ambrose "haunting" of
   Rollins, to where it makes perhaps too much sense to me. If this were
   real life, then yes, he would need to work on letting go. Perhaps
   that‚Äôs why fiction is so great; it will be cathartic to watch him get
   revenge.

   He may be a lone wolf, but he values his closest friends.

   Dean‚Äôs entire mission in WWE-life right now centers on the loss of a
   friendship. He‚Äôs not the party boy in the middle of the crowd, a la
   Dolph Ziggler, with a bunch of other friends to turn to. But being on
   your own doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt care about other people ‚Äì it might
   simply mean that you zero in on a couple or few people who matter to
   you the most, and you don‚Äôt let go of them.

   Even though WWE hasn‚Äôt maintained the Ambrose/Reigns connection the way
   I would have liked, they did give it a nice nod on the way out, with a
   Renee Young interview during the RAW post-show on June 9 in which
   Ambrose promised they‚Äôll still travel and hang out together regardless
   of Triple H‚Äôs desire to break them apart. And on a SmackDown a few
   weeks later, Reigns ran in to help Ambrose during a beat-down.
   Additionally, when Orton beat up Reigns on RAW a couple weeks back, it
   was mentioned that Ambrose was not in the building; I like to think
   that was because Ambrose wouldn‚Äôt have allowed Orton to get away with
   that.

   Dean doesn‚Äôt appear to have many friends, but the ones he has, he cares
   about ‚Äì Reigns, whom he‚Äôs loyal to, and Rollins ‚Äì whom he couldn‚Äôt keep
   as a friend, but he doesn‚Äôt have the capacity to "just move on" from a
   personal connection like that. I get this completely ‚Äì I usually want
   to be alone, but when I connect to someone, I care to a level I can‚Äôt
   describe.

   Watching Dean Ambrose has become less about "ooh, he‚Äôs cute" or "ooh, I
   like that guy ‚Äì I hope he wins." It‚Äôs become more about admitting, "I
   see aspects of myself in him." When someone puts him down, when he‚Äôs
   treated unfairly, I feel for him and with him, far more than anyone
   else on the roster. When he succeeds ‚Äì not just in a match, but in
   standing up for himself, in making himself heard, in getting justice ‚Äì
   I feel great.

   And now I can admit to myself that it‚Äôs less about him, more about
   realizing how this character makes me reflect on who I am as a person.
   Who knew you could get that much self-reflection out of a wrestling
   show?

   Thanks, Ambrose.
