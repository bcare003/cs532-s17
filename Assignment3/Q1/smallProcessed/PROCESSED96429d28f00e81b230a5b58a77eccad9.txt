Vegan Diets, As Long As They Are Well-Balanced, Are Good for Pregnant Women
and Children

   By [40]Lisa Ryan

   A leading nutritionist group says vegan diets are healthy for everyone.

   Many people have wondered whether vegan or vegetarian diets are healthy
   for pregnant women or infants, particularly after horror stories
   emerged in recent months of kids [48]b[49]ecoming malnourished after
   their parents fed them [50]plant-based diets. However, according to new
   guidelines by a leading group of nutritionists, plant-based diets are
   actually really healthy for just about everyone to follow, as long as
   they’re well-balanced.

   Nearly 3.3 percent of all American adults are vegetarian or vegan —
   diets that are way more common in younger adults than elderly people,
   according to the new guidelines in the [51]Journal of the Academy of
   Nutrition and Dietetics. All in all, plant-based diets are “healthful,
   nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits for the
   prevention and treatment of certain diseases,” the Academy of Nutrition
   and Dietetics wrote in their position statement. That’s largely because
   people who follow these diets typically eat less salty and sweet
   snacks, and more fruits and vegetables.

   The recent terrifying instances of “vegan” diets harming children
   occurred when their diets lacked proper nutrients. It’s essential for
   people who follow plant-based diets, or feed them to their children, to
   make sure that their meals are planned out and well-balanced,
   registered dietitian nutritionist Vandana Sheth, of the Academy,
   told[52] Reuters. Vegan and vegetarian children, in particular, need
   diets that are rich in iron, zinc, and vitamin B-12, as well as calcium
   and vitamin D in some instances.

     “Any diet that is not well planned and balanced can have negative
     side effects. Just because foods are plant based doesn’t
     automatically make them healthy. For instance, pastries, cookies,
     fried and salty foods may be vegan but don’t really provide much in
     terms of nutritional value.”
