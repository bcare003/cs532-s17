There’s only one word to describe that match – Phenomenal! ‘The Phenomenal
One’ AJ Styles had a brutal war with John Cena at ‘SummerSlam.’ After these
two exchanged devastating moves, it was AJ who walked out the winner!

   There was no championship on the line for this match. It was all about
   pride when John Cena, 39, stepped in the ring with AJ Styles, 39, on
   Aug. 21. These two foes have been battling back and forth for months
   and it came to a head at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.

   This match was amazing – and painful to watch! AJ delivered a suplex on
   the apron, dropping John’s spine across the edge of the ring. Ouch.
   Later in the match, AJ countered John’s Attitude Adjustment, hitting a
   Pele kick before landing the Styles Clash. And John kicked out. Styles
   returned the favor, kicking out of the AA. AJ even hit an AA of his
   own!

   They pulled out jaw-dropping move after jaw-dropping move, even a
   top-rope AA. The end of this highly physical match came when AJ his the
   Phenomenal Forearm for the victory! This match will go down as a modern
   classic!

   When AJ made his WWE Debut at the 2016 Royal Rumble, every member of
   the WWE Universe was asking “When will he face John Cena?” John seemed
   to answer that question when he made his return to the WWE on May 30,
   following shoulder surgery. The man dubbed “The Face that Runs the
   Place” attacked AJ and his fellow members of The Club, Luke Gallows,
   32, and Karl Anderson, 36. This led to a match between John and AJ at
   WWE’s Money In The Bank on June 20.

   AJ walked away the victor that night, courtesy of some interference
   from Luke and Karl. John seemed to get some revenge when he teamed up
   with Enzo Amore, 29, Big Cass, 30, to take on all three members of the
   Club. During the thrilling climax, Cena hit is finishing move on AJ,
   [43]the Attitude Adjustment, off of the second rope! It was all just a
   matter of counting the 1-2-3 after that.

   The Club is no longer unified, as [44]Karl and Luke were drafted to RAW
   while both John and AJ headed over to SmackDown Live! AJ hasn’t needed
   any backup to torment Cena, as he has mocked the 15-time World
   Champion, saying that John’s tenure as the icon of the WWE is over.
   After that impressive victory, it looks like AJ might be right.

   What do you think about John vs. AJ, HollywoodLifers? Did you think the
   better Superstar won? Should either John or AJ now compete for the WWE
   World Championship on SmackDown Live?
