[25]This Comedian Got The Best Revenge On A Woman Who Refused To Clean Up
After Her Dog At The Airport!

   [26]February 24, 2017 [27]admin [28]Leave a comment

   Some people need a really good dose of karma sometimes!

   A comedian who was confronted with an extremely thoughtless and
   careless woman at the airport had the best revenge for her awful
   behavior.

   [29]Related: #BootBae Is The Most Dramatic Viral Saga Of 2017

   In a [30]story posted to Reddit, Steve Hofstetter chronicled the
   HIGHlarious tale of how he gave a woman her comeuppance after she let
   her dog poop inside LAX and didn’t clean up afterwards!

   Hofstetter related how the woman had been “loudly face-timing with her
   back to the dog” and didn’t notice that her pup was going number two.
   When a man pointed it out to her she just rolled her eyes at him. When
   she walked away without picking up the poop, another woman asked her if
   she was going to clean it up, and our lovely antagonist said, “They
   have people for that.”

   The gall!!!

   The story got even better when Hofstetter got to his gate and saw the
   same woman loudly listening to music without headphones. Let the
   comedian himself tell the rest:

     “When I got to my gate, the woman was there, too. Great – we were
     both going to Tokyo. When I travel abroad, I get embarrassed by
     other Americans doing things one hundred times less embarrassing
     than leaving animal feces on the floor of an airport. To make it
     worse, her dog was now barking at everyone who walked by. While her
     dog barked at the world, the woman had moved from face-timing with
     no headphones to listening to music with no headphones.”

   He continued:

     “Everyone else tried to ignore her, sitting as far away from her as
     they could. I am not everyone else.

     I sat down right next to the horrible woman. “Are you going to
     London on business?” I said.

     “I’m going to Tokyo,” she responded gruffly, annoyed that I
     interrupted her DJing.

     “Oh, I said. Then you better hurry. That flight got moved to gate
     53C. This is the flight to London.”

     I figured I could give her a little moment of panic as payback for
     how terribly she was treating everyone. I didn’t predict what would
     happen next. She grabbed her bags and her dog in a huff, and stormed
     out of the gate without even checking. She was so self-involved, she
     didn’t notice that the monitor at our gate still said Tokyo and
     almost everyone at the gate was Japanese.

     The flight to Tokyo was at gate 69A, so the 53 gates were on the
     other side of the next terminal. And I felt guilty knowing she
     probably berated some poor clerk who had to explain to her that
     there was no gate 53C.

     I don’t know if she made it back to this flight before we took off
     or not, but I didn’t see her board and I don’t hear her dog. Her
     missing her flight was not my original intention, but it would be a
     fine punishment for her being so rude to everyone and making a
     low-paid stranger clean feces off the floor.”

   HAHAHA! We hope she missed her flight! That would be sweet, sweet
   karma.

   Some people naturally doubted Hofstetter’s story, so he posted his
   [31]airline ticket online.

   Still, we guess it could all be a hoax, but we’re choosing to believe
   it.

[33]NASA snaps pics of the world’s largest solar farm from space

   Park on January 5, 2017

   With [37]renewable energy on the rise, it makes perfect sense for the
   title “world’s largest solar plant” to change hands pretty quickly. In
   2014 for example, the 550 MW Topaz Solar Farm held the title, to be
   toppled in November by a 648 MW plant in [38]Kamuthi India. At this
   point in time, China’s Dam Solar Park has risen above them all with 850
   MW of capacity, and NASA has now provided some imagery that offers a
   different perspective on all that clean, green power.

[52]Watch Young Thug Seek Security in ‘Safe’ Video

   [53]February 24, 2017 [54]admin [55]Leave a comment

   Young Thug returned Friday from a six-month post-Jeffery hiatus with
   his surprise new video for “Safe.”

   Produced by his go-to collaborator Wheezy, the Atlanta rapper opens up
   about the insecurities and paranoia that comes with success. “I spend
   more money on security than I make,” he says. “Just to be safe.”

   The accompanying video is similarly understated as Young Thug
   brandishes high-end designer clothing and stacks of foreign currency
   while singing along to the song in an all-white office building and
   darkened elevator.

   Most importantly, Young Thug actually appears in “Safe” after
   [56]bailing on the shoot for his “Wyclef Jean” video, which became a
   viral hit.

   Following a 2016 that saw the release of three Thugger LPs – I’m Up,
   Slime Season 3 and Jeffery, the latter earning a spot on[57] Rolling
   Stone’s 50 Best Albums of 2016 – the prolific rapper has eased back on
   the rapid-fire releases since Jeffrey dropped in August. However, as
   Young Thug notes in the caption of the “Safe” video, “I will never
   quit.”

   Yeezy Mafia has done it again. The YEEZY Boost rumor specialist has
   just shared what appears to be official adidas images of the YEEZY
   Boost 350 V2 “Cream White.”

   The site has correctly called a number of popular release dates, and
   even shared [122]official images of the “Zebra” YEEZY weeks before
   [123]this weekend’s drop.

     — Yeezy Mafia (@theyeezymafia) [126]February 24, 2017

   The “Cream White” colorway sees the redesigned V2 model dressed up in a
   silky smooth off-white. The images show that the “SPLY-350″ lettering
   has also been whited out to the point where it’s almost
   indistinguishable from the rest of the upper.

   Yeezy Mafia says the shoe will release in both adult and kid’s sizes
   sometime in April. Spy the pics above and stay tuned for more
   information.

   In other sneaker news, adidas is re-releasing the Ultra Boost 3.0
   “Triple Black” [127]next week.
