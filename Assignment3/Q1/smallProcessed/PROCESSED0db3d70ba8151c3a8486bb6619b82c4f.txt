       POTUS Trump isn't the one that called it a terrorist attack, that
       was the MSM exaggerating. What he did say was "look what happened
       in Sweden last night". Meaning he had watched a report from a film
       maker Ami Horowitz that is filming a documentary on the impact of
       refugees in that country. The locals are reporting that crime went
       from a few cases a year to several a week now. Rape alone has
       increased 500% but the local police & their government is greatly
       down playing the actual figures.

     * Trump is lying but his useful idiots who put him in office will
       never admit that their judgement
       in political presidential choices is lame. they are stuck with
       having to defend a bad choice.
       EDIT Obama is not "my buddy". I am a Conservative. Not a fake,
       tooless, back water, NAZI-lovin, southern Conservative though.

       Trump tweeted that he got the information about "what happened in
       Sweden last night" from Fox News. Fox was talking about the
       correlation between crime stats and Muslim immigrants in Sweden.
       So, he misinterpreted fake news and told it to you people. the
       journalists are right, Trump is wrong.

       In Trumpland I guess Trump. In the real world the journalists. The
       pitiful defense of that statement with pointing out generalities
       when a specific date was mentioned shows how many people here
       reject reality for Trumpland.
