Sami Zayn Calls John Cena “One of the Greatest Wrestlers Ever”, Praises WWE
Raw Experience, Bret Hart & Comments on Shoulder Injury

   [15]WWE.com has a new interview up with Sami Zayn, who answered the
   U.S. Open Challenge this past Monday night on WWE Raw and came
   face-to-face with John Cena.

     “It’s really hard to pinpoint one emotion. There was a pretty wide
     spectrum of emotions the entire night, from curious to nervous to
     excited to confident, back to nervous, back to excited, defiance and
     pride with how long it took to get there … how hard the road was. It
     was a mix of emotions. I can’t pick out one thing within the span of
     an hour, let alone the five minutes while Cena was talking.”

   Zayn discusses paying $13 to be in attendance at Survivor Series 1997
   in his hometown of Montreal, to see his hero Bret Hart on what would
   become the most infamous night in WWE history.

     “Bret Hart was my hero. Now, the same guy I paid to see — my hero —
     was the one introducing me and shaking my hand when I got in the
     ring. It was surreal, very surreal. I guess I didn’t fully
     understand what it meant until it happened.”

   He praises U.S. Champion John Cena and calls him “one of the best
   wrestlers ever,” and stating that he was proud to share the ring with
   the 15-time world champion.

     “What an endorsement, from two of the biggest stars of all time. I
     can carry that going forward. After you have a match like that, you
     have momentum. I’m happy that I was able to have the match that I
     did with one of the best ever in my hometown. You really can’t ask
     for much better. Ultimately, I’ll look back at it as a very positive
     experience. I wouldn’t be Sami Zayn if it went too well, there’s
     always gotta be a bump in the road. Overcoming it is the story.”

   While Sami did address his injury on Monday night, we are still
   awaiting the official word on whether or not he will participate in the
   NXT Championship match at the upcoming NXT Takeover live special on May
   20th. For now, you can check out more of this WWE.com exclusive
   interview with Sami Zayn at the link provided above.
