   Should she decide to pursue a career in WWE, Ronda Rousey received a
   hearty endorsement from Roman Reigns.

   In a Tuesday [29]interview with Hannah Storm on SportsCenter, Reigns
   said he thought Rousey would make a seamless transition from MMA to
   professional wrestling.

   "I think she's one of those athletes that gets that attention and all
   eyes are on her," he said. "So I think she definitely has the
   background, and she's got the base to build on, so she's got a great
   foundation."

   Rousey made a cameo appearance at WrestleMania 31 in March 2015 when
   she and The Rock confronted Triple H and Stephanie McMahon.

   In a November 2015 interview with Rolling Stone's [31]James Montgomery,
   Rousey said she'd be open to showing up in WWE again:

     I'm ready. I've seen NXT, I remember [Natalya] and Charlotte's match
     for the title. Nattie was actually training with the original Four
     Horsewomen to get ready for that fight. I have so many obligations,
     but I really want to find a way to make it happen. I'm a huge fan
     wrestling, and I would like to see the position of women in the
     sport continue to improve, so if I can be a part of it, great.

   Following Rousey's loss to Amanda Nunes at UFC 207 in December, many
   have wondered whether the former UFC women's bantamweight champion
   would consider a career change.

   She has seemingly accomplished everything she can in UFC. By moving to
   WWE, she'd be able to earn a healthy salary and rebuild her aura of
   invincibility, much as Brock Lesnar has since returning to the company
   from the UFC in 2012.

   Some might argue Rousey's arrival would somewhat undermine
   WWE's burgeoning women's division since it would take attention and the
   spotlight away from the full-time wrestlers. WWE's continued reliance
   on part-time stars such as Lesnar, The Rock, Sting and Bill Goldberg
   has often come at the cost of the long-term development of WWE's
   younger wrestlers.

   Still, Rousey would bring a lot of mainstream attention to WWE and, if
   done right, could elevate the entire women's division, exposing more
   fans to the in-ring product.
