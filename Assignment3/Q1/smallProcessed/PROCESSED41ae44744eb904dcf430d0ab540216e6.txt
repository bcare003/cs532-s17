AJ Styles, Raw-SmackDown Trade, a New Day Split and More from the Rumble
Mailbag

   WrestleMania season is almost here. For now, though, Royal Rumble
   season is here. It feels like WWE is having two WrestleManias in 2017
   with the Rumble—headlined by Brock Lesnar and Goldberg—taking place in
   the Alamodome. With The Undertaker coming around, another blockbuster
   matchup could be on the horizon for AJ Styles.


   New Styles

     Jimmy Rodopoulos @Jimmy_Rodop

     @ThisIsNasty What is next for AJ Styles? Is it time to push Miz back
     to the main event?
     [29]12/8/2016, 2:16:45 AM

   Now that Styles' feud with Dean Ambrose is (hopefully) over, he'll move
   forward with plans to face James Ellsworth for the fourth time. From
   there, according to Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter
   (h/t Raj Giri of [30]Wrestling Inc), there's a good chance he will face
   The Undertaker at the 2017 Royal Rumble.

   Once Styles is healed up, WWE should have the WWE world champ squash
   Ellsworth convincingly because it'll make him that much stronger of a
   potential opponent if he faces The Undertaker, and that's what
   Ellsworth is for.

   Styles may not be The Undertaker's final opponent, but he just might
   represent the final opportunity for Undertaker to have one last great
   match.

   The Miz would be a great choice to feud with Styles if The Phenomenal
   One was the babyface he is naturally meant to be. An Ellsworth-Styles
   pairing is awkward since they're both heels at the moment, and it would
   only make sense for Styles to continue to be a heel if he feuds with
   Undertaker. But a possible babyface turn coming out of the Royal Rumble
   would open the door for what could be an entertaining Miz-Styles
   clash.


   SmackDown Your Trade

     [32]@ThisIsNasty Do you think there will ever be a trade between
     Smackdown & Raw and if so between who?
     — Carter (@JustCarter87) [33]December 8, 2016

   Raw and SmackDown have not done enough with the trade concept during
   the brand split. Jack Swagger jumped ship as a free agent earlier this
   year, but that helped nobody. In real life, especially when it comes to
   sports, many disgruntled and underutilized athletes either get traded
   or demand a trade.

   This would be an easy storyline to turn frustration into momentum. In a
   dream scenario, Sami Zayn would get traded for Apollo Crews. Both came
   with a lot of promise in the New Era but have struggled mightily to
   find their footing. Zayn has endured a lot of friction with Raw general
   manager Mick Foley of late, and writers hid Crews in the pre-show at
   TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs.

   These talented yet damaged WWE Superstars need a fresh start, and a
   rare trade would give them appropriate new beginnings.


   The Next Day

     [34]@ThisIsNasty who from the new day will have the most success
     when the group inevitably splits?
     — Conor Doran (@BigD_Doran) [35]December 8, 2016

   The New Day has been a national treasure as a unit. A potentially
   looming heel turn could add months, if not years, to this stable, but
   coming up on two strong years, one has to at least begin thinking about
   life after The New Day.

   Big E is equipped to become the runaway singles star of The New Day. At
   35 years of age, Kofi Kingston is an elder statesman in WWE. Woods,
   who's typically booked as a part-time manager, has a low world
   championship ceiling. Big E, the wildly charismatic strongman who is
   convincing as a tough guy in the ring, is just right.

   Big E enjoyed a lengthy run as NXT champion, so he is no stranger to
   being pushed as a promotion's top champion. Seth Rollins, Kevin Owens
   and Finn Balor are past NXT champions who went on to win world
   championships in WWE. Then again, former NXT champions Sami Zayn,
   Neville and Bo Dallas have all seen their careers stall on the main
   roster.

   There's no guarantee Big E will become a world champion once The New
   Day disbands, but he has the right combination of youth (30), size
   (5'11", 285 lbs) and charisma on his side to be a formidable choice.
