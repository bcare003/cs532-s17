   Professional wrestling superstar John Cena was on Thursday’s “Today”
   show to surprise 8-year-old Rocco Lanzer with the granting of his
   Make-A-Wish request, an event that will include ringside seats to
   Monday night’s post-SummerSlam episode of “Raw” as well as gifts and a
   party. As significant as the occurrence was for Rocco, it’s even more
   significant for the Make-A-Wish Foundation itself, as it marks the
   500th wish granted by Cena for the organization.

   “No other person, celebrity or otherwise, has granted more wishes than
   he has,” Make-A-Wish spokesman Josh deBerge said in an interview on
   Friday. “Not only has he granted more wishes than anyone else, John
   repeatedly grants amazing wishes every time he meets a wish kid.”

   Cena’s involvement with the foundation began in 2004 and has expanded
   with time. In 2009, he received the organization’s Chris Greicius
   Celebrity Award, given to celebrities for outstanding commitment to
   wish-granting. He granted his 300th wish in 2012 and 400th in 2014, the
   first celebrity to reach each milestone.

   Cena is carrying on a long tradition of granting wishes within the
   wrestling world. WWE’s involvement with the foundation reaches back to
   the early 1980s with Hulk Hogan. In the time since, more than 6,000
   wishes have been granted by the WWE, with nearly 50 wrestlers
   participating in wishes since 2001. At Friday’s event lauding Cena’s
   accomplishment, the sports entertainment company made a $1 million
   commitment to Make-A-Wish.

   Though Cena’s slate is always full (this wish alone comes the day after
   SummerSlam, one of the WWE’s marquee pay-per-view events, at which he
   will wrestle against current heavyweight champion Seth Rollins), this
   summer has been particularly active, including his comedic role in
   “Trainwreck” and a stint co-hosting the “Today” show earlier this week.
   But he always manages to find time to grant wishes.

   “I’ll drop everything. If I can offer a fantastic experience, I’ll be
   first in line to do my part,” said Cena, making his trademarked catch
   phrase “Never give up” less of a slogan and more of a lifestyle.
