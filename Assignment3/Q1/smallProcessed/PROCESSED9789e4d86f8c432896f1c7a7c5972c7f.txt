   What are your thoughts...
   Consistent facts only
   Who's the best of the two?
   Fighting all powers at the top of their game?

   without prep, at their absolute best (without upgrades), I go with
   Doctor Strange. He hold the best record from their fights

   Well Dr. strange had to help Doom after he became sorcerer supreme
   because Doom was the only survivor. after Strange helped Doom, try to
   reclaim his mother, Strange wondered if Doom had it planed from the
   start. so its possible that Doom gave up being sorcerer supreme so that
   Strange would have to help him, knowing he would survive the test and
   be granted a boon by doing so.

   According to Wanda, Dooms magic is more powerful-

   I think Stranges strength lies in versatility and skill instead of raw
   power.

   Strange can tap into more raw power without the need of artifacts like
   cosmic cubes. He's basically a conduit for the power of cosmic beings,
   which is a perk of being the Sorcerer Supreme.

   Doom can tap into external power sources as well. Thats normal for a
   sorcerer. Unless you are inherently mystical yourself (i.e part faerie
   like Morgan Le Fey) then you do not generate your own power internally
   but instead tap into the ambient mysetical energy of the universe
   and/or call on the power of mystical entities.
   According to Wanda an accomplished sorceress herself and who has
   experience wielding far greater energies than either Doom or Strange,
   Dooms magic is generally stronger.
   However with that said Strange was the Sorcerer Supreme for a reason
   and i believe part of the reason is down to greater mystical knowledge
   which allows for greater versatility and skill in wielding mystical
   energies. Doom may have more raw power but strange can defeat him
   through greater skill. Thats how it generally is with strange and his
   opponents.

   I think people forget that although dr doom has people greater than him
   he is the single greatestbmind in th universe when he wants to be...
   He did trick the BEYONDER and take his powers over, which I think
   trumps all because that would be the height of his power.... And it be
   Dr. Doom BEYONDER powers VS strange...
   But even before the the BEYONDER move I think that dr. Dooms greatest
   power is his mind and I personally think not only is he stronger, but
   he is smarter...
   And dr strange only became sorc supreme. Because doom talked him into
   it... So I think if you can control your upon to thinking they are
   making their own choices and they are actually baring your biding
   without their knowing it your better!
   I have a bias opinion on the matter doom is one of my top three
   characters!
   ....
   But per comics he is better by feats alone, he basically controlled all
   of existence for a short period, as well as before that I he was pretty
   impressive his super villain resume opens all kinda doors at interviews
   I bet!

   Doc has more overall raw power (according to feats) as well as
   knowledge/experience in the mystic arts. In Triumph/Torment Doc trained
   Doom before they went to Mephisto's realm. Doom also tried Doc once
   with the Crimson Bands and Doc schooled him, reversing the spell
   telling Doom that they were not conjured properly. If this thread
   doesn't involve Doom using power stealing prep, then he pales in
   comparison to Steve.

   Classic Steve crushes doom sans prep.

   Oh yeah, and as far as Wanda goes, Doc put an unstable Wanda into a
   coma. Cap wondered if she was still alive or not.

   But at the end of that Strange wondered if Doom hadn't had the whole
   thing planned out. Doom had to much pride to ask Strange for help, so
   he might have intentionally got the bands wrong so that strange would
   turn them back on him, and in doing so protect him from the tests
   onslaught. and also forcing Strange to grant him a boon, which was
   Dooms intention all along.

   Dr Doom n prep beats anyone
   Dr Doom intelligence I think trumps the doc I think anyway...
   He has tricked him before... He could find away to win!

   I think Stranges strength lies in versatility and skill instead of raw
   power. vice versa Strange himself has gone to doom stating he was
   probably the more skilled between the two overall barring Stranges
   benefit of being Sorcerer Supreme. Have to find where he said it.

   Not sure if that's the case. I was thinking Doom turned on him because
   they were the only two sorcerers left at that point. Regardless, Doc
   proved to be superior for the simple fact Doom had to increase the
   power output on his armor multiple times just to keep up with the
   training. It was also Docs shield that kept them from being incinerated
   vs. Mephisto.

   from the greatest sorcerers.

   Yeah I know about your thread. I was hoping he'd point out something
   specifically off hand tho.

   great thread but unsure..
     __________________________________________________________________

   Estacado
   Right now I would say Doom.
   However retro Strange should be above Victor imo.
     __________________________________________________________________

   TheHulk
   Strange, especially Classic Strange.
     __________________________________________________________________

   DarkRaiden
   Doom. Strange has stated that Doom knows more than him, Scarlet Witch
   said Doom was more powerful. Plus he practically oneshotted Strange in
   Unthinkable.
   Oh and he beat Morgana La Fey in a pure magic battle so that's
   something.
