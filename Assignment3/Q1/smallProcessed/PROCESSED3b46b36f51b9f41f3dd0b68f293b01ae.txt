     * I will continue to say this, New Day shouldn't split, they should
       branch out!
       Woods would be an awesome addition to the cruiserweight division,
       while Big E and Kofi could switch between the midcard and main
       event.
       Wwe could also keep them together (Kofi and Woods) as Raw tag
       division is thin, and have one (Big E) fight for the U.s or
       Universal championship, while the other two manage him.
       Maybe even go as far as to start building New Day as a single
       person.
       Ex:
       Summerslam: U.s championship match
       Rusev vs New Day
       Kofi could be fighting Rusev for the U.s championship, and instead
       of him facing Rusev, Big E could sub in for him. As they constantly
       say, "when one is champion/successful, they all are successful!"
       To answer the op question though, I would say Woods could stand out
       of three if given the chance. He's great on the mic, good in the
       ring, and seems to be more diverse than the other two.

     * Must all teams end in a split? History has shown us time and time
       again that teams generally produce one monstrously successful
       person while the other is left behind.
       Jannetty, Neidhart, Christian and others never quite saw the level
       of success as their partners. But what if after kicking him through
       the Barbershop window, Jannetty turned bad too and became a
       sidekick and enforcer to Michaels?
       What if Edge and Christian stayed allied through the years? The
       list goes on. DX is a team that were associated although primarily
       singles stars. Why not follow that model?
       Big E goes after the US title? His brothers stay by his side.
       Xavier makes weight for the new crusierweight division, what if he
       holds that title but they're still New Day?
       I could see this as a working model. The Hardys had single runs in
       WWE during the late attitude era, but usually didn't break up when
       they happened. I remember Jeff holding the Hardcore title for a
       while and Matt having European run while never turning on each
       other.
       The heel turning model suggests a fundamental alteration of the
       characters presented on screen. When the characters are popular and
       over with the fans, why risk that model?
       In the case of New Day, we already know they work as heels, but
       that was as a team. Keep them together no matter how high they
       sore.
       But if they split I don't see any of them getting very far. I'd
       love to see the whole group turn heel again some day, but not soon.
       Xavier will stay popular as a face, Kofi will struggle to connect
       and Big E will get a push based on size.
       Big E will be the most successful on his own based on that alone.
       He's large enough to hit the main event but he's got a pretty big
       glass ceiling over his head. He's shown so much personality in New
       Day.

     * If New Day ever were to split up (which they should NOT) then the
       one to stand out would be Kofi. He was the best of the three before
       New Day formed, he's the best of the three now, and would be the
       most likely to succeed in the future without the stable. He's done
       it all at this point other than winning a World Championship and
       with having been allowed to show a little more aggression he could
       certainly have done it by now. I hated both Woods and Big E before
       New Day, and I was admittedly wrong about how good they are.
       Without New Day they'd be slightly less interesting though. Even in
       Kofi's case they all benefit more from being together. The way they
       work so well together both as a team in the ring and in their
       promos together is awesome. If they did split I could see Kofi
       getting more midcard success while the other two get lost in the
       shuffle. If they remain together, they will be remembered as one of
       the best teams from this era. They should NEVER split. The New
       Day's popularity speaks for itself.

     * Xavier Woods.
       He is so underrated in the ring while he rarely works a match. He
       being serious could a nice view. He is quite good on the mic and
       almost the backbone of New Day.
       Big E is good too. His initial feud with Dolph was par but New Day
       made him and vice versa.
       Kofi was already credible as a midcarder before New Day.
       Unfortunately, none of these would be able to go over upper-midcard
       level.

     * Splitting would be a mistake as the reason New Day works is their
       synergy... together they are stronger than ANY of the 3 could ever
       be individually.
       Big E. is a misnomer, WWE got burned on Reigns so they won't try
       that again, even if he is the physically bigger. Kofi is pretty
       much set now as the modern day Tito Santana, he'll be there or
       there abouts in the Upper mid card, have his Rumble moments but it
       won't get any bigger for him alone.
       Woods DOES have a potentially interesting future, but again he'd
       probably be limited to the IC or US titles (which for him would
       have ALWAYS been a great achievement) or if the Cruiser division
       isn't working/needs him, he'd be a great front man for it. Woods
       has the most upside in terms of character and outside projects but
       his small size will always work against him in the end when it
       comes to in-ring action.
       I could easily see Woods ending up in a role similar to Miz when he
       was going through the belts, just without the World title
       accomplished. I could equally see him in a WWE sponsored comedy
       vehicle and away from the ring altogether.

     * Honestly, dont think WWE expected them to work this great. They
       were just 3 guys WWE had nothing to do so they stucked them as a
       team. And it payed off beyond wildest expectations. Proof is that
       they are still a team and still going strong and still Tag Team
       Champions.
       As a singles act, cant see anybody but Big E to make it. Xavier is
       comedy gold but he would be new Santino if even WWE allows him
       that. Kofi is what, 4 times Intercontinental and 3 times US
       Champion and 4 times Tag Team Champion. And yet, eventhough he won
       all that, only time he even felt important is when he was feuding
       with Orton or doing spots at Rumble and now with New Day. Big E
       could have great singles career if they decide to push him after
       New Day. He has size, ability and has improved on mic so could be
       saomeone who would benefit after this.

     * I remember when they gave Kofi a mini push when he destroyed Ortons
       car then pretty much destroyed Orton in Madison Square Garden.
       It didn't last long of course. I don't think there is much for any
       of them if they split so they shouldn't split. Sure change them up
       once in a while, but why kill a good thing?
