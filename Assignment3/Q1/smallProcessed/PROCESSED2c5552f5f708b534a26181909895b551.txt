   Speculating on the rumors surrounding pro wrestling is a favored
   pastime of many fans, perhaps second only to actually watching the
   matches. In this daily column, we take a look at the latest rumors
   being churned out by the pro wrestling rumor mill.

     Important reminder: Rumors are just that -- rumors. None of this has
     been confirmed as legitimate news or fact, it's just circulating
     around the pro wrestling rumor mill. Remember, take it all with a
     grain of salt.

Rumors for the Day:

     * The situation with Seth Rollins currently looks like this, though
       this is all, of course, unconfirmed: Rollins had his social media
       hacked, which led to pictures of Zahra Schreiber, who recently
       signed with WWE to work in NXT, being posted on his account. These
       are, apparently, pictures he possesses of her. It's possible that
       his fiance is the one who hacked his account to post the pictures.
       This led to said fiance posting his nude photos and going on
       various other places, like Facebook, and posting supposed text
       message exchanges between Rollins and Schreiber.

     * John Cena is dealing with an eye injury and it's bad enough that
       WWE wrote it into the storyline with Rusev to help explain it away.
       Apparently it happened at a house show.

     * Sting was not actually at Raw, backstage or otherwise. Yes, the
       people who saw were extras (as if that wasn't obvious), but he
       wasn't in the building at any point.

     * According to PW Insider, Larry Zbyszko will be the next inductee
       into the WWE Hall of Fame class 2015.

     * Regarding Alex Riley not being on the Raw pre-show, the word going
       around is that when he returns he'll do so as a wrestler instead of
       an analyst.

   If you have heard of any interesting rumors that you'd like to add,
   feel free to post them in the comments section below. Just remember
   they are rumors and not confirmed as fact, so please take them as such.
   Have fun with it.
