   From humble beginnings as an ultra-low-budget splice series that no one
   thought would take off, all the way to present day success, it’s easy
   to imagine [25]Power Rangers going the way of [26]The Simpsons and just
   never ending. We’ve had dinosaurs, ninjas, magicians, kung-fu masters,
   dinosaurs again, post-apocalyptic defenders, samurai, dinosaurs for a
   third time and soon, ninjas again. This Power Ranger train isn’t
   stopping any time soon.

   But there’s one who stands out as the greatest, most long-lived Ranger
   of all time. He’s cycled through [27]a few colors, but few nineties
   kids would fail to recognize Tommy Oliver as the Green Mighty Morphin
   Power Ranger, the one who started evil and became a legend.

   Not much has been said on Tommy joining us for [28]Saban’s new movie
   series, but until then, here are some Green Ranger facts you may not
   have known…

15. He Was the First Ever Sixth Ranger

   Green power Ranger Power Rangers: 15 Things You Didnt Know About the
   Green Ranger

   The addition of a sixth ranger is as old as the hills in Power Ranger
   lore, being present in every series in some form and pretty much
   (poorly) lampshaded into oblivion during Megaforce. You’ve got your
   core team of five, after which the sixth ranger enters the fray, gets
   their own special storyline, becomes so hyper-competent for a few
   episodes that he/she makes the rest of the team look like incompetent
   chimps, and then just sort of settles in for the rest of the series.
   With some slight variations, that’s your basic Sentai/PR formula, with
   the only exceptions being Ranger-ish characters who hang around the
   main team and do most of the same stuff (a la Magna Defender).

   Except in Zyuranger (the series that spawned the American Mighty
   Morphin’ counterpart), the Green Ranger was a ground-breaking event.
   While the very first for worldwide viewers, Zyuranger came in at number
   sixteen overseas, yet it was also the first to feature a sixth ranger.
   What’s more, it was a rogue ranger who tried his best to destroy the
   main team before converting to the side of good. The end result was the
   same in both English and Japanese: a breakout character who proved
   popular enough to become the face of the series, return time and time
   again, and also start a sixth ranger tradition that’s been going strong
   ever since.

14. His Sentai Counterpart Died

   Burai Super Sentai Power Rangers: 15 Things You Didnt Know About the
   Green Ranger

   Like Tommy Oliver, the Sentai Green Ranger is considered one of the
   most iconic and enduring characters of the series, to the point where
   many would tune in for the character alone. Sadly this wasn’t to last,
   as while the PR version simply lost his Green powers, Tommy’s Sentai
   equivalent Burai straight up died.

   Yep, Japanese kids are apparently made of sterner stuff than the rest
   of the world — or at least, the censors seem to think so — because they
   didn’t shy away from having a Ranger die on-screen. Twice, in fact.
   With his powers dwindling, Burai was confined to a cave for most of the
   time, resting in suspended animation when he wasn’t sorely needed. He
   eventually ended up being crushed in a cave-in, which as far as Power
   Rangers deaths go is right up there in terms of childhood trauma. This
   explains Tommy’s lack of appearances in Power Rangers, mostly handwaved
   as him being off doing karate, or sleeping in, or forgetting his
   communicator, or some other excuse that makes him a terrible defender
   of the Earth.

   Later briefly resurrected, Burai was able to last a while longer before
   his powers were finally exhausted and he died again, this time for
   good. That was until one of the many, many specials in which he was
   brought back, because nostalgia mixed with merchandising profits is a
   combo potent enough to literally wake the dead.

13. That Awful Dragon Shield Replica

   Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Power Rangers: 15 Things You Didnt Know
   About the Green Ranger

   Speaking of differences between versions, of which there are many,
   let’s talk about that Dragon Shield. It’s perhaps the main reason you
   can recognize the Mighty Morphin Green Ranger a mile away, because
   without it he’s just another member of the team in ill-fitting spandex.
   It also just looks really great…except when you switch from grainy
   Sentai footage to any of the original American stuff, when it turns
   into a floppy paper nightmare that couldn’t defend you from a
   particularly antagonistic stiff breeze.

   Saban either had their props shipped over, made them in-studio or just
   tried to splice together footage to make it look like…well, yeah, the
   American suit actors and that monster are TOTALLY fighting each other,
   you guys, come on. The monster fired a thing and the Rangers fell down.
   Flawless editing.

   The iconic Dragon Shield was unfortunately damaged in transit, leaving
   Saban to hastily cobble one together for their future cash cow and his
   original footage scenes. What we got was a sad, floppy bit of fabric
   that had no place drooping wearily around the neck of a planetary
   defender. They’d make their own, more solid version for future seasons,
   but for the Green Ranger’s actual career, he had to wear a shield that
   even the four-year-old demographic thought looked trashy. Things really
   got awkward when Tommy solemnly passed the shield onto Jason, who had
   to employ all of his acting chops to pretend that this was a great
   honor and not the equivalent of receiving a knitted jumper from your
   myopic grandmother.

12. Green Became White (with some stock footage trickery)

   White Mighty Morphin Power Ranger Power Rangers: 15 Things You Didnt
   Know About the Green Ranger

   Whether you were totally into him hogging all the screen time or raging
   at how all of Rocky’s focus episodes were passed over (because we all
   wanted to know more about that guy, right?), Tommy quickly established
   himself as the most popular and profitable member of the team. Even
   with all the Sentai footage exhausted, he was just too much of a fan
   favorite to be written out; thus, a costume from another series
   entirely was shipped in for Tommy to continue as the White Ranger,
   stock footage be damned. The White Ranger became the leader (because
   again, merchandising trumps everything) and Tommy managed to hold onto
   this position for a good few years until halfway through Turbo. By this
   time, he’d been through five Ranger suits (ninja, Zeo and Turbo on top
   of Green and White) and even then, the character wasn’t quite done.

   Jason David Frank would return as a Power Ranger veteran in Forever
   Red, and later in Dino Thunder as a Black Ranger, before again donning
   his original Green suit for the Legendary War.

   The final tally? That’s six Ranger powers, six Zords, four different
   colors and a grand total of 234 episodes. Thus far, anyway. It’s pretty
   safe to say this guy is the face of Power Rangers, even if most people
   only remember him as the long-haired guy in green.

11. Evil Green Doppelgangers, Everywhere

   Evil Green Ranger Power Rangers: 15 Things You Didnt Know About the
   Green Ranger

   If there’s one thing Power Rangers loves, it’s flashy, ineffective
   high-kicks. Second on that list is stock footage. Third are storylines
   where the Rangers are either turned into wacky things or put under
   spells to make them act weird, and in fourth place is reusing plots.

   Running with that last one, we’ve seen countless versions of Rangers
   having to fight evil doppelgangers of themselves, spawned from one evil
   source or another. Tommy being the marketing poster child, this tends
   to happen to him a lot, particularly in regards to the Green Ranger. In
   MMPR alone he tussles with evil versions of himself several times, be
   it either dark illusions or actual clones brought to life by dang-nasty
   magic. The trend continues in Dino Thunder, where a comatose Tommy has
   to engage in [29]mental warfare with Zeo Ranger Red, the White Ranger
   and finally the Green Ranger, which sort of makes sense. Green is his
   greatest challenge, since he had his origins in being Rita’s
   brainwashed flunkie and it’s probably been a sore point ever since.

   Tommy wasn’t alone in this, of course; the other Mighty Morphin’
   Rangers had their fair share of evil clones, ranging from transformed
   putties to creepy stalker statues brought to life (Billy had a very
   tangled love life). Still, with so many pretty colors and powers to
   choose from, Tommy always seemed to get hit with this the hardest.

10. The Green Ranger Was Never Meant to Last

   Green Ranger with Candle Power Rangers: 15 Things You Didnt Know About
   the Green Ranger

   Fun fact: Power Rangers was only ever meant to get one season before
   wrapping up. It’s a bizarre thought, looking back at how it’s still
   going strong on both TV and soon the big screen two decades later, but
   that was always the deal. Saban was adapting a bizarre Japanese series
   and splicing footage to try to make something that kids would want to
   watch, for a little while at least. It wasn’t a fool-proof plan. Then
   Power Rangers would just become another, brief relic that [30]people
   from the internet age would one day dig up and laugh at.

   Obviously things didn’t go to quite the way they were expecting, and
   the series became mega-hit and a merchandising juggernaut. And what of
   the Green Ranger? His story was meant to end pretty early on as well.
   Footage for the character was limited, given that he was kind of
   sporadic in the original, meaning that he was always planned to be a
   character who came, went, came, went and finally lost his powers before
   returning to a normal life of street karate and morning hair-brushing
   sessions.

   Cue the popularity explosion, and it’s really not hard to see why he
   became the star of the show. The Green Ranger saga shook up the tired
   formula like nothing else, marked a huge shift in the mythos and
   introduced the mother of all breakout characters. When the footage ran
   dry, it was purely down to Tommy’s popularity that he was dragged back
   into the fray in a costume that never quite fit the aesthetic. The kids
   didn’t care, buying up White Tigerzord toys in droves and ensuring that
   Rocky never got any decent focus episodes. [31]Yeah, screw Rocky.

9. Jason David Frank’s Achievements in Breaking Stuff

   Jason David Frank Power Rangers: 15 Things You Didnt Know About the
   Green Ranger

   Jason David Frank hasn’t done a huge amount of acting outside of Power
   Rangers, but he’s certainly kept busy in the intervening years
   nonetheless.

   Originally auditioning for the role of [32]Red Ranger Jason at the age
   of 17 (yes, they were actually teenagers — just about) before later
   returning as Tommy, Frank was continually kept on in Power Rangers due
   to his popularity with the viewers, which eventually ran out around the
   middle of Turbo. This led to him focusing on mixed martial arts, which
   was one of the reasons he scored the role in the first place.

   Though only debuting on the pro scene in recent, Frank has done pretty
   well for himself in terms of accomplishments and records broken, with
   even a Guiness World Record under his belt for ‘Most pine boards broken
   in freefall’. It’s likely that most of us have no idea what that is or
   what it entails, but it’s nearly impossible not to think of Jason David
   Frank swooshing through the air, yelling one of Tommy’s famous “kiai”
   (preferably the one that sounds like ‘woodzeep-YUAAH’) and smashing a
   load of boards in glorious slow motion.

   You can take the guy out of Power Rangers, but not the other way round.

8. Zyuranger: Not Quite the Same

   Zyuranger Cast Sentai Power Rangers: 15 Things You Didnt Know About the
   Green Ranger

   Tommy Oliver’s Japanese counterpart as the Green Ranger was Burai, or
   more accurately ‘Yamato Tribe Knight Burai’, because it’s Japanese
   television and everything has to be eight times as long. It’s really
   impossible to understate how different Zyuranger and Mighty Morphin
   Power Rangers really are, because aside from coloured suits and Zords,
   you’d never even think that one spawned the other. For example, the
   Blue Ranger is kind of an idiot, the Yellow Ranger is a guy, and
   there’s no Zordon or Alpha; just an old guy with a staff.

   The team from [33]Zyuranger are all from prehistoric times and are
   reawakened to fight evil in the modern era, hence why they hang out
   with dinosaurs and have wacky, fish-out-of-water adventures when not
   piloting [34]their gigantic mechs. The Green Ranger saga has a few
   similarities, with Burai carrying out a vendetta against the team and
   working alongside Rita (or ‘Witch Bandora’), but things otherwise run a
   lot deeper. Burai has a serious grudge against Red Ranger Geki going
   back millennia, which is far too complicated to explain (again:
   Japanese television) but basically drives all of Burai’s actions.

   After coming to his senses, Burai joined the team, but since his powers
   were tied to the green candle, he could only fight for short periods of
   time and when the team needed him most. Afterwards, he’d return to a
   cave where time was stopped, preserving his life. He eventually died
   for good after his cave was destroyed, prompting a furious
   letter-writing campaign from fans to bring him back to life.

   Naturally, as in Power Rangers, the writing staff relented and Burai
   was…wait, no, they didn’t. They left him good and dead as a lesson to
   all the kids that sometimes, heroes die. So either that scarred an
   entire generation or taught them a valuable lesson. Perhaps both?

7. Tomberly Shippers on Deck

   Tommy Kimberly and Kat Power Rangers: 15 Things You Didnt Know About
   the Green Ranger

   Ever since Tommy came on the scene, the show started to revolve around
   his romance with Pink Ranger Kimberly (which here means ‘they
   occasionally kissed each other on the cheek and stuff, because
   censors’). The two remained an item even after Kimberly left the show
   and passed her powers onto Katherine, even if it never really went much
   further than your typical high-school dating.

   Things would all come to an end during the course of Zeo, when Tommy
   received a breakup letter from Kimberly so devastating he could only
   cope by walking alone on the beach while thinking of all the sweet
   cheek-kisses they’d shared and how one day they were going to move onto
   lip stuff. If shipping was even a thing back in the nineties, fans were
   surely outraged (much like they currently are over [35]the budding
   Jason/Kimberly romance in the new film).

   The former Green Ranger’s love life has scarcely been revisited since
   then, though one episode of Zeo featured a possible version of the
   future in which Tommy is married to Kat and their grandchild is a Power
   Ranger. This opened up a ton of plot holes and once again didn’t go
   over too well with fans, thus causing it to be scrapped. Nowadays,
   Tommy is apparently just an ordinary science teacher, single and thus
   free to go off to save the world at a moment’s notice.

6. All of Tommy’s Suits Are Different Sentai Characters

   Zeo and Turbo Red Dino Thunder Black Power Rangers: 15 Things You Didnt
   Know About the Green Ranger

   Super Sentai has always had a slightly stronger continuity than PR,
   with multiple crossovers and guest appearances to really solidify the
   madcap Japan in which these people live and pilot giant,
   monster-stomping robots. Still, the team rotations have been a staple
   from the start, starting pretty much every time with a team of fresh
   faces.

   That’s the state of Power Rangers at the moment, but in the early days,
   the same characters moved through powers like they were just switching
   clothes, with Tommy sticking around the longest. With even Billy
   jetting off to an alien planet to hook up with a telepathic fish-girl
   (don’t ask), Tommy continued into Turbo and became a sort of relic of
   the old times, at least until he passed the powers on. Years later,
   he’d be back as the Black Dino Thunder Ranger…which at this point meant
   he’d technically played five different people. [36]MMPR Green, White,
   Zeo and Turbo Red, Dino Thunder Black; the Sentai versions were all
   different characters from completely separate seasons, most of whom had
   never even met each other.

   Footage-wise, they managed to get away with this by casting Jason David
   Frank as roles that were either leaders or mentors (so the folks in the
   suits acted more or less like he would), but it’s most telling in his
   role as the White Ranger. The original had an actual child in the role
   who grew to full size when morphing (don’t ask), meaning that Tommy
   could often be seen bouncing up and down like an excited toddler or
   generally emoting in ways that didn’t really suit him. Ah, the perils
   of meddling with stock footage.

5. Tommy Almost Headed a Global Organisation

   power rangers 5 ninja storm Power Rangers: 15 Things You Didnt Know
   About the Green Ranger

   Fun fact #2: we got pretty close to having a Power Rangers series
   titled ‘Hexagon’, and it would’ve been awesome. An ambitious project
   from the start, it would’ve focused on a central, public organization
   of hundreds of Power Rangers that protect the world from global
   threats. Think S.H.I.E.L.D., but with more colourful spandex outfits.
   The series would’ve focused on new recruits,  tied up loose ends from
   all the seasons that came before, featured appearances from many past
   villains and cameos from a ton of past rangers, including Jason as the
   leader of a group of renegade rangers.

   Tommy would’ve been in the mix, of course, this time as the director of
   the organization and pretty much Zordon with limbs and hair. The series
   was meant to adapt Hurricaneger, which eventually became Ninja Storm
   after the Hexagon plans fell through. Remember Cam, the Green Samurai
   Ranger? As in the first one, not the other one? Had Hexagon gone ahead,
   this would’ve been Tommy’s Ranger form, as it resembled the original
   MMPR Green Ranger in aesthetics, and we couldn’t have a series
   featuring Tommy Oliver where he isn’t right on the front lines, hogging
   the glory for himself but instantly being forgiven because he’s Tommy
   Oliver.

   Sadly, Hexagon was dreamt up at a time when the future of the series
   was in flux, and the plans were abandoned in favor of another
   conventional series. Still, it’s spawned no shortage of fan-fiction
   over what could have been.

4. The Green Ranger and the Legendary Battle

   Jason David Frank Green Ranger Power Rangers: 15 Things You Didnt Know
   About the Green Ranger

   The more recent Megaforce was intended as homage to all that came
   before, with the team using Ranger powers from all seasons and the
   whole thing culminating in a massive battle with every past Ranger
   fighting to save the Earth from an alien invasion. Yes, even Rocky.

   Tommy was right in the thick of things, naturally, only this time he
   was using the powers of the Green Ranger. If we’re sticking to
   continuity, the only powers he should’ve had at this point were those
   of the Red Zeo Ranger. The original Power Coins were definitely
   destroyed, because new toys had to be sold and it was getting really
   hard for Zordon to keep coming up with reasons to give the Rangers new
   tech. Meanwhile, the Green Ranger powers were long gone by that time,
   having been drained away and rendering Tommy an ordinary human.

   But hey, this is Power Rangers. Screw continuity, right? It shouldn’t
   have been possible, but the Green Ranger form was just too iconic not
   to use for the Legendary Battle. Thus we had Jason David Frank once
   again donning the green suit, now with a Dragon Shield that didn’t look
   like it was made of soggy cardboard and a few modifications to his
   helmet. Possibly allowing us to overlook this was the fact that almost
   every single Ranger in history showed up for the fight, including those
   who’d lost their powers, or the ones who were in deep space, or in
   another dimension, or the ones that shouldn’t even be there because the
   person who wore the suit is right there next to them. Yeah, continuity
   is a pain like that. Doesn’t matter, it looked cool.

3. Doctor Oliver’s Suspicious Credentials

   Tommy Oliver Power Rangers: 15 Things You Didnt Know About the Green
   Ranger

   The [37]recent trailer for the 2017 Power Rangers movie may have only
   been a teaser, but it did give us [38]a few hints as to the major
   changes fans are in store for. We see at least one actual parent, Rita
   is apparently several degrees more competent than her TV counterpart,
   and night-time actually exists within this universe. [39]Also,
   personalities.

   The original characters had their quirks, sure, but a few suffered from
   an overarching blandness. Trini in particular always just seemed like
   she was there to fill a yellow suit, Zack was a walking stereotype, and
   this team of ‘teenagers with attitude’ were actually the sweetest
   so-and-sos around. Meanwhile, perhaps by virtue of sheer screen-time,
   Tommy was fleshed out more quickly. We knew that he loved karate and
   Kimberly, had a memory like a colander and was a bit of a doofus when
   it came to academics. Any school subject that wasn’t ‘spin kicks’
   seemed to leave Tommy baffled, which is why him resurfacing years later
   with a hastily-acquired PhD had many a long-time fan confused.

   Cue the fan theories as to how he pulled this off, ranging from batting
   his perfect eyelashes at the professor all the way to gaining advanced
   intelligence after having his brain scrambled. PR villains mess with
   the Rangers’ heads so often you’d expect Zordon to schedule regular
   psychiatry sessions, but at one point during Zeo, Tommy was kidnapped
   and brainwashed into thinking the Rangers were villains. This seems to
   be the incident that many have latched onto to explain Tommy’s sudden
   scholastic excellence. Though we’re honestly not discounting the
   eyelashes thing.

2. Rita: The Former Green Ranger?

   power rangers rita repulsa elizabeth banks Power Rangers: 15 Things You
   Didnt Know About the Green Ranger

   Speaking of Rita Repulsa, she seems to be one of the most hotly
   anticipated parts of the upcoming movie, which is par for course when
   we’re talking about giving Elizabeth Banks a role where she gets to be
   creepy and weird. She’s like the second coming of Johnny Depp in his
   prime.

   We’ve been tossed snippets of information about the character, with one
   being particularly interesting: she has a complicated history with the
   Power Rangers. There have obviously been previous teams, and as
   confirmed by Rita herself in the teaser trailer, she’s had great fun
   killing them in the past. But has this been as a straight antagonist?
   As many noticed with the release of both the Rita and Ranger suit
   images, there’s a striking similarity. Take a suit, color it green and
   it starts looking a lot like a more whole, less-broken version of what
   Rita’s wearing. Plus, there’s [40]the whole ‘green power ring in her
   staff’ thing.

   This leads to the obvious theory: [41]Rita used to be a Power Ranger,
   and something caused her to become so disillusioned that she turned
   against the group and became their greatest enemy. The color would make
   her the previous Green Ranger, which makes perfect sense considering
   her connection to the Green power in the series. TV Rita held the Green
   Power Coin for reasons never explored, but if the movie version used to
   use its power as a force for good, this would perfectly explain why she
   has it lying around. And speaking of which…

1. The Future of the Green Ranger

   Green Ranger Comic Power Rangers: 15 Things You Didnt Know About the
   Green Ranger

   With Saban ambitiously [42]planning seven movies in their new saga, the
   chances of us NOT seeing the Green Ranger cropping up at some point are
   sitting at a hearty 0%. Seriously, one of the very first promotional
   images hinted at Rita’s connection to green, even if her outfit is just
   a coincidental design choice. The Green Ranger is perhaps the most
   iconic of the original MMPR team, the one who established the sixth
   ranger trend and the most famous Power Ranger of all time. [43]Expect
   serious hints towards the existence of the Green Ranger, if not an
   outright appearance in the first movie.

   As for solid evidence, there’s not much beyond the image of Rita and a
   lot of fan speculation. Jason David Frank has stated that he’s hopeful
   for a Green Ranger spinoff series, something similar to the current
   deal with Wolverine with more color and probably less stabbing. Given
   that the first PR movie is still yet to be released, it’s not exactly
   something to get your hopes up for, but it remains an interesting bit
   of future speculation. In any case, the future coming of the Green
   Ranger to the movie universe will be a momentous occasion, perhaps
   enough to warrant a film all by itself. There are a lot of Power
   Rangers storylines that should never even be touched with a ten-foot
   pole — [44]Ticklesneezer, looking at you — but [45]Green with Evil is
   movie material already.

   Do you know of any other fun facts about Tommy Oliver, the Green
   Ranger? How soon do you think he’ll show up in the new film series?Let
   us hear your thoughts in the comments.
