Elimination Chamber Fallout! WWE Smackdown Live Preview!

   Coming out of the Elimination Chamber PPV, newly crowned WWE champion
   Bray Wyatt will defend the title against John Cena tonight on Smackdown
   Live. Would make sense for Bray to keep the title till WrestleMania so
   he can continue the ongoing storyline with Randy Orton who won the
   Royal Rumble match.

   After winning the Women’s championship for the first time in her career
   Naomi will be on the show to address her win and it will be interesting
   to see when will Alexa Bliss invoke her rematch clause? Also the bigger
   question is who will Naomi face at WrestleMania in her hometown of
   Orlando as the Smackdown women’s division is wide open.

   Could Baron Corbin be next in line to challenge Dean Ambrose for the
   Intercontinental title? Amrbose snuck up from behind and eliminated
   Corbin from the chamber match but after ‘The Lone Wolf’ took his
   frustrations out on the Lunatic Fring by hurling him through the Lexan
   glass and delivered the End of Days. After winning the Andre The Giant
   Memorial Battle Royal at last year’s WrestleMania, winning the IC title
   would at Mania this year would be a nice step up the ladder.

   After surviving the Tag Team Turmoil match at the Elimination Chamber
   PPV, the Smackdown tag team champions American Alpha will face the The
   Usos who look to be next in line. As the Usos attacked Gable and Jordan
   after their elimination.

   With rumours flying around that A.J. Styles will face Smackdown Live
   Commissioner Shane McMahon at WrestleMania it will be interesting to
   see how WWE builds this match.

   Also with Nikki Bella and Natalya ending in a double count-out expect a
   big stipulation and television match to happen either tonight or next
   week on Smackdown Live to end this feud. As it looks like Cena and
   Nikki will face The Miz and Maryse at WrestleMania as that’s the
   direction that came out out of that backstage scuffle with Maryse.

   Additional WWE News:

   On 205 Live tonight we will see the Cruiserweight Champion Neville face
   T.J. Perkins on the WWE Network after Smackdown Live.
