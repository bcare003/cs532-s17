   Former WWE Superstar Ryback was a guest on The Ross Report with WWE
   Hall of Fame broadcaster Jim Ross this week. You can check out the
   complete interview with [15]The Big Guy at Podcastone.com.

   On how life on the road prepared him for his career after WWE:

     “I’m very thankful for everything wrestling related, and my time in
     WWE. I always talked about how I rode alone. On those car rides, I
     look at that as very valuable time to myself. Anywhere from three to
     six hours on a lot of nights, where I could listen to audio books
     and learn about anything I wanted to learn about, and get a free
     education on the road while still doing what I love to do.”

   On Vince McMahon and the importance of wrestlers communicating with
   management when they have issues:

     “It’s a creative business. It’s his world, and if he doesn’t like
     you – and I know there’s guys there now that he’s sour on – and I
     always wondered why haven’t they gone in there and communicated?
     They’re just living week to week. In this day and age, a lot of guys
     walk on egg shells, and that’s what I’m proudest about myself. I’ve
     always stood up for myself, and I’ve gone and communicated. When I
     thought Hunter was against me on things, I’ve gone and I’ve talked
     to him. Do I think he was always honest with me? No, but I always
     approached him and I tried to talk to him, and gain ground, because
     if I don’t nothing’s gonna change. So I had nothing to lose. You
     gotta get rid of that fear mindset very early on, and most of the
     guys won’t. The ones that do, will do themselves the biggest favor,
     and helping themselves as they get to the main roster.”

   On working with Paul Heyman and how Heyman’s relationship with CM Punk
   was screwing him over:

     “I respect Paul [Heyman] a lot, and he’s lasted in this business a
     very long time, but we didn’t see eye to eye. Paul and CM Punk were
     really, really good friends. Heyman was supposed to be, from a
     creative standpoint, working with me. And he was with Punk all day
     and they were discussing business, and what they were going on to
     do, and it wasn’t doing me any favors and I knew that. We were
     overseas on an England tour [when] I finally had enough. Paul knew
     he had to get away from me, because I was gonna kill him at the
     time. He had went to Vince, him and Punk, and they didn’t do me any
     favors in there talking to Vince. I talked to Paul that night at
     catering at the hotel,” … “I had one last discussion with Paul at
     the catering table, in which he bought me beers for about two hours,
     as I cut a two-hour promo on him on everything, and what I thought
     of him, and how he did his business with me. He held a butter knife
     in his hand, twirling it the entire two hours. I kid you not, CM
     Punk walked around in circles the entire time, acting like he was
     gonna try to do something, while I was talking to Paul cutting this
     promo on him.”

   His reaction to CM Punk’s negative comments about him on the
   now-infamous Colt Cabana podcast:

     “Not to say Punk gets along with everyone to begin with – he’s kind
     of his own individual, and a self-admitted asshole at times, but he
     was always friendly with me. But you gotta remember, when you’re
     dealing at the WWE level, and you’re dealing with those top slots,
     you’re dealing with millions of dollars. The two guys I had all my
     problems with, and everyone else there I’d get alone with just fine,
     was John Cena and CM Punk. There’s only a certain amount of slots
     there, and those guys have those slots, and they wanted to keep
     them. I do think Punk, he was really beat up during the periods that
     we worked together, physically, and he complained about other guys
     when he was there that are notorious for being good workers. I just
     think he was physically beat up, and he was frustrated, and he
     lumped that all in.” … “He had his issues with WWE, I think I just
     got lumped into all that. It is what it is. I don’t hate him, not at
     all.”

   On CM Punk fighting in the UFC:

     “I’m happy for him, as far as the UFC. I know the fight didn’t go
     the way that he wanted it to go, or have the performance that he
     probably felt that he could have had. But having the courage to just
     take that chance, and anybody who knocks him for that, they have no
     idea the courage that it takes to be able to go out there and fight
     in front of the world. Essentially it’s being a modern day
     gladiator.” … “I think it’s cool. I wish him the best in everything
     that he’s doing going forward.”

   On CM Punk’s frustrations with WWE and how the “WWE machine” effects
   wrestlers:

     “He was never the stereotypical WWE guy. He always had to eat shit,
     so to speak, from day one. He broke a lot of doors down up there for
     a lot of the independent guys. He kinda had to live through that
     first hand, where guys now are getting opportunities from the
     independents, he didn’t necessarily get all of those right off the
     bat, probably like he felt like he should have.” … “Vince and the
     WWE, they’re a business. They essentially whore you out and run you
     into the ground, and then they replace you. Because there are so
     many guys who want those spots, and the brand is so strong now, that
     they can do that and get away with it. It gives you a negative
     feeling on wrestling at times. I feel like Punk had a lot on his
     shoulders, with the creative and the injuries, where it kind of
     makes you resent the job a little bit. And I think that’s where you
     can become a little bitter, and a little angry. Even though he had a
     lot of success, I feel like at times, but in his mind probably not
     the level that he wanted. And I can understand that because I know
     the level of success that I wanted, and wasn’t happy with that. And
     for him I think it was main-eventing WrestleMania. I think for him,
     after experiencing the struggles that he did early on just to get
     there, and then getting there and having success finally, and
     finally breaking through, and then still not actually truly getting
     that spot that he really wanted – his goal, so to speak – I think it
     was just a culmination of everything.”
