       U.S. healthcare might learn a thing or two from the modus operandi
       of Google’s fleet of autonomous vehicles — the information and
       skills that self-driving vehicle systems must share represent
       compelling models and lessons that might be adapted to healthcare.

       If you’ve read the latest headlines about Britain’s tech industry,
       you’d think the country hadn’t been rocked by the greatest
       political and economic uncertainty since the Second World War. Not
       only are UK startups raising record amounts of funding year on

       The e-Golf, Volkswagen’s electric version of its popular compact
       car, officially gets around 50 percent more range this year than it

       125 miles on a single charge (via Autoblog), compared to 83 miles
       before. The 125-mile range is still a far cry from the Chevy Bolt’s
       industry-leading EV range, but the e-Golf is not… [160]Read More

       Self-driving trucking startup Embark is revealing its tech for the

       neural networks and deep learning to teach trucks how to drive
       themselves through their own processes of practice and trial and
       error. Embark’s trucks are also approved to test on Nevada roads,
