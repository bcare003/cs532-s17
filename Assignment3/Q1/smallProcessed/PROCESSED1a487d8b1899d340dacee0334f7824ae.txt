Triple H's, Samoa Joe's Best Booking Options Through WWE WrestleMania 33

   On Monday's episode of WWE Raw, Samoa Joe attacked Sami Zayn before the
   latter's match with universal champion Kevin Owens, lending more
   credence to the likely partnership between the two men and chief
   operating officer Triple H.

   With just over a month until WrestleMania 33, the relationship between
   Joe, Owens and Triple H is one of the most intriguing storylines right
   now. How these men are booked heading into the company's biggest
   pay-per-view of the year is imperative to the show's success.

   Here are the best booking options for both Triple H and Samoa Joe
   heading into WrestleMania 33.

   Triple H's Best Booking Options

   The best booking option for Triple H would be a match against Seth
   Rollins, which WWE Creative has teased for months. Whether Rollins'
   knee will be healthy enough for him to compete at WrestleMania is a
   major question mark, though.

   Rollins is scheduled to appear on next week's episode of Raw, and the
   WWE Universe is hoping for some clarity on his medical condition. If
   there is any way the former world champion can be cleared for the April
   show, WWE Creative should keep hope alive.

   On the other hand, if Rollins is not cleared by WrestleMania, Triple H
   should only be involved in a segment where he gloats about how Rollins
   didn't make the show. The Architect can then make an appearance.

   While having Rollins attack him would be the best scenario if he is
   cleared for light contact, this would also be the perfect spot to get
   The Rock involved. With WrestleMania in Orlando, Florida—a place with
   history for The Rock—having him hit the ring and go to bat for Rollins
   would make for an amazing moment.

   This booking would also continue the storyline between Rollins and
   Triple H down the line.

   Samoa Joe's Best Booking Options

   Since making his main-roster debut, Samoa Joe has been booked as one of
   the strongest forces in WWE, and it is important he has a WrestleMania
   match to reflect that.

   While a match against Triple H would be a marquee bout that could solve
   the problem of what to do with both men if Rollins isn't cleared,
   rushing that storyline would force Joe to be a face, and he's a better
   heel.

   Another option would be for Joe to take on a returning Finn Balor if he
   is cleared by WrestleMania. While it's hard to be confident in the
   health of an injured Superstar just weeks before the biggest show of
   the year, WWE's options are limited.

   Add in the excitement that would surround the rehash of the Joe vs.
   Balor feud from NXT on the main roster, and most wrestling fans would
   be all-in.

   If Balor isn't cleared for WrestleMania, either, then Joe should be
   placed in the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal. While Braun
   Strowman and Baron Corbin are early favorites, Joe could easily run the
   table and walk away with the trophy.
