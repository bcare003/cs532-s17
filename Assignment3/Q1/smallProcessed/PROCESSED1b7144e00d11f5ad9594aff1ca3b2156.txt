The Bitch in You: Revisiting Ice Cube and Common’s Vicious 90s Rap Battle

Before they were big screen buddies, the two headstrong rappers needed
Minister Farrakhan to mediate their beef
     __________________________________________________________________

   To the average person, one who might know Ice Cube and Common better
   for their acting roles than their music, it would appear that these two
   accomplished performers have always been friends. But before they were
   sharing the screen in this April’s Barbershop: The Next Cut—a film
   produced by Ice Cube—the two endured one of the meanest and most
   lyrically compelling battles in hip-hop history.

   This unexpected clash between two gifted and well-respected artists
   would act as the tipping point for the heavily publicized East
   Coast/West Coast rap feud that would follow. The venom that
   spewed—along with the accompanying behind-the-scenes drama—was so heavy
   that Minister Farrakhan organized a peace treaty between the warring
   rappers. Let’s put it this way: seeing these two rap giants co-starring
   in a comedy is akin to Drake and Meek Mill co-piloting a Bad Boys
   remake. It’s almost that unimaginable.

   Here’s how it all started: On September 27th, 1994, young Chicago
   rapper Common Sense released a song called “I Used to Love H.E.R.,” the
   acronym standing for “Hip-hop in its Essence is Real.” As the first
   single from his second album, Resurrection, the song was a
   cleverly-penned metaphor about a girl that Common fell in love with,
   who by the end of the song is revealed to be the personification
   hip-hop music and culture itself. The song was a hit with finicky East
   Coast rap heads, who more or less met Common’s first album, Can I
   Borrow a Dollar? with a collective shrug.

   “Common was kind of getting love in New York, the label was New York,”
   says Dug Infinite, who was producing tracks for Common at the time.
   “Peter Kang was managing [New York DJ troop] the X-Ecutioners and was
   his A&R at the time and Com was getting paired with the Beatnuts on a
   lot of tours. From being out there a lot, it seemed like he was getting
   a lot of love at the time, even New York citizens would be like ‘Yo
   that’s Com!’ in the cab or whatever. I think ‘I Used to Love H.E.R.’
   kind of did that for him.”

   But Common’s portrayal in the song of how the once-pure hip-hop
   transformed into the more sensationalized, negatively-tinged “gangsta
   rap” rubbed Ice Cube the wrong way. Common rapped:
   [1*HWMetV12dCHPLAB3RN9EgA.jpeg]

     “But then she broke to the West Coast, and that was cool / Cause
     around the same time, I went away to school / And I’m a man of
     expanding, so why should I stand in her way / She probably get her
     money in L.A…

     “Talking about popping Glocks serving rocks and hitting switches /
     Now she’s a gangsta rolling with gangsta bitches / Always smoking
     blunts and getting drunk / Telling me sad stories, now she only
     fucks with the funk.”

   “They took that as a dis,” says Infinite, who also was Common’s
   Relativity Records label mate. “Honestly I don’t think Common ever
   intended that as a dis, more it was Common just trying to actively tell
   his version of the history of what happened to hip-hop.”

   “In my mind, it was purely descriptive. I was talking about hip-hop’s
   life cycle and how the West Coast cats had really taken over by the
   1990s,” Common revealed in his 2011 memoir, One Day It’ll All Make
   Sense. “But I guess Ice Cube heard my song different. I was in New
   York, hanging out backstage at an Alkaholiks show, when King T said,
   ‘Yo, Com, you heard that Cube verse? He’s talking about you. It ain’t
   really that bad, though.’ The way he was saying ‘It ain’t really that
   bad,’ I knew that it had to be precisely that bad.”

   IFRAME: [17]/media/b0d73c9b927cca2f5c0fc87b4f1018a5?postId=1e5ef9deaeba

   The verse in question was on Mack 10’s “Westside Slaughterhouse,”
   featuring Ice Cube and W.C. Incidentally, it was released as a single
   on September 28th, 1995, one year and a day after the release of “I
   Used to Love H.E.R.” But the buzz began a few months earlier in June,
   buried deep in the track list of Mack 10’s self-titled Priority Records
   debut. It would be the first time that Ice Cube, Mack 10 and W.C. would
   record together unofficially as Westside Connection, escalating the
   highly publicized East Coast/West Coast rap war that was gestating in
   the early 90s among artists like Tim Dog, N.W.A, The Dogg Pound, Tupac
   and Biggie. While many of these artists danced around it with years of
   indirect “sneak disses,” “Westside Slaughterhouse” ignited the powder
   keg. Ice Cube rapped:

     “Used to love her, mad cause we fucked her / Pussy whipped bitch,
     with no common sense / Hip-hop started in the West / Ice Cube
     bailin’ through the East without a vest…”

   In four provocative bars, Cube made the declaration that hip-hop
   culture started in California—rewriting history and omitting 1520
   Sedgwick Ave in the Bronx, NY from the equation. Common was caught in
   the middle of the crossfire of it all, both figuratively and
   geographically.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Ice Cube was already coming under fire from his audience, despite
   releasing a series of four arguably classic solo records, each released
   only a year apart from one another: Amerikkka’s Most Wanted, Death
   Certificate, The Predator and Lethal Injection. Criticisms were hurled
   at Cube among his fanbase for various reasons, such as borrowing
   (jacking?) the beat to Grandmaster Flash & Melle Mel’s “The Message”
   for the “Check Yo’ Self” remix, despite Puffy doing it again
   successfully three years later. Cube was also criticized for ripping
   off the hook to Cypress Hill’s “Throw Ya Set In The Air” for “Friday,”
   as well as trying to balance the contradicting reckless lifestyle of a
   gangster rapper and that of a straight-edged member of the Nation of
   Islam in his music. When he took aim at the East Coast with Westside
   Connection after working with Public Enemy, the Bomb Squad and Das EFX
   just a few years earlier, fan frustration with Cube had reached the
   boiling point. Common’s response record couldn’t have been better
   timed, capturing the sentiment of the hip-hop audience at the time.

   “I just kind of smiled, like, ‘Okay, I see how it is,’” Common recalls.
   “I probably wouldn’t even have reacted further if Cube and his people
   hadn’t kept talking about it. Westside Connection went on BET’s Rap
   City taking trash about me. That brought my Chicago up. So I decided I
   needed to bust back with a track. That’s how ‘The Bitch in Yoo’ was
   born.”

   Common was working primarily with Chicago producers No I.D. and Dug
   Infinite at that time, who released Accept Your Own and Be Yourself
   (The Black Album) on Relativity Records in 1997. “I don’t think No I.D.
   wanted to do the beat. For one he was working on his album, but I don’t
   think he wanted to be pulled into the beef. He wanted to be more the
   producer that worked with everybody. So Com went to get Pete Rock to do
   it,” Infinite recalls.

   “I remember getting a phone call from [Common] saying how upset he was
   about getting disrespected by Ice Cube. I told him, ‘If you need my
   help, I’m here,’” producer Pete Rock [18]revealed in 2011. “He came to
   New York and we hung out at a friend’s house. I made that beat at a
   friend’s house with records that I had given him so he could make
   beats, because he made beats too. I left them over there, [so I used
   the records] and came up with the track. I couldn’t believe that
   [Common] would like it. I thought I would have to go home among my
   stuff. He was right there with me when I made it.”

   DJs Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito Garcia debuted the track on their
   legendary WKCR radio show in 1996, but in a different incarnation than
   the version that was released at retail. While the first verse was
   unchanged, the unfinished demo version that was aired included two
   deleted verses, which were not about Ice Cube. Rumors swirled that the
   demo version’s second verse was aimed at Common’s label mate Fat Joe,
   who released the single “Shit Is Real” in 1993. Common’s verse started
   out “If it’s really real Joe, let that shit show for self / No need
   parading guns, murders or your wealth.” It was speculated by fans that
   the verse was changed because Common and Fat Joe were both members of
   the Relativity Records roster. But that couldn’t be further from the
   truth.

   IFRAME: [19]/media/9912ebf5ec2afad0f6d62c4d01fc6826?postId=1e5ef9deaeba

   “That had nothing to do with Fat Joe,” says Infinite. “Joe is a term in
   Chicago that they give to somebody when they don’t want to just call
   you by your name. ‘What’s up, Joe?’ Or Charlie. If you really don’t
   want to give him honor by calling him his name, you’d call them a Mark,
   a Vic, a Joe or a Charlie.”

   The origins of the slang go back even further: during the Vietnam
   conflict, when “Viet Cong” was shortened to “VC” or “Victor-Charlie” in
   the NATO phonetic alphabet. “When the enemy was out there he was a
   ‘Charlie.’ When older cats from Chicago came back from Vietnam, they
   started addressing people that they didn’t have love for as Charlie.
   That went into Joe and all of that other stuff. So that’s all that
   was,” Infinite adds.

   “The first time I performed the song was down in Atlanta at this music
   festival,” Common recalls. “Cube and his people were also on the bill.
   I didn’t know who else was out in that crowd, but I didn’t really care.
   ‘Man, fuck Ice Cube!’ I was thinking. So I had them turn down the
   beats, and I spat that first verse a capella. The crowd went wild. A
   few weeks later, I performed the song at the House of Blues — the House
   of Blues on the Sunset Strip in L.A.! They loved it too. That made me
   write another verse talking about ‘even in your town, they be loving my
   shit!’”

   IFRAME: [20]/media/74cc0773bb16b44ebf1669b324818696?postId=1e5ef9deaeba

   The song was finally released as a promotional single, with No I.D. and
   Dug Infinite’s “The Real Weight” on the b-side. It was given official
   release on a Relativity Records compilation called Relativity Urban
   Assault. The end result was perhaps one of the most scathing dis
   records ever, firing on all cylinders as Common was able to verbalize
   exactly what fans were feeling about Cube at the time. Loaded with
   clever puns, he called him out for pandering to the East Coast and then
   rebelling against it (“Went from gangsta to Islam to the dick of Das
   EFX”). He blasted him for contradicting Muslim teachings (“Hypocrite,
   I’m filling out your Death Certificate / Slinging bean pies and St
   Ide’s in the same sentence”). And perhaps most brutally, he ended the
   song by using Cube’s own lyrics against him (“In the immortal words of
   one, a bitch is a bitch.”)
   [1*anxJIGgFLYmJJx8CZ5e_eQ.jpeg]
   [1*50vNYtXu6pm_3rTXei8Tug.jpeg]

   “When Common responded, his rap was so dope. He went in on Cube, he
   killed Cube! And Cube was one of the dopest at the time! He was the man
   and Common ate him up. He spanked him,” says Chicago rapper D.A. Smart,
   who would later play a small role in the saga.

   “Cube was already known for being a notorious dis guy too, already
   coming hard at his old crew mates [N.W.A] with ‘No Vaseline,’” says Dug
   Infinite. “I think it was kind of like ‘If you’re going to come at Cube
   lyrically, you better come with it, or he’s going to body you. So I
   think Com felt that way, being the lyricist that he is.”

   “He was charged up. I felt, as a man, if you feel disrespected, and you
   feel that in your heart, you fire back. That’s what it is. That’s how
   real men are supposed to get down,” says Pete Rock. “But this was a wax
   thing. I think Common stood up as a man and told him how he really
   felt. It was memorable, man. Very classic moment.”
     __________________________________________________________________

   Yet after the murders of 2Pac and The Notorious B.I.G. in 1996 and
   1997, it was clear that these lyrical rap battles were becoming more
   than just a “wax thing.” Minister Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of
   Islam organized a peace summit with several feuding rappers on April
   3rd, 1997, less than 30 days after Biggie’s death on March 9th that
   year.

   “Rumors were swirling that it could get deeper than just the music.
   Common’s camp called it, Cube’s camp called it. Cube’s camp was cool
   with the Minister. Common was cool with the Minister. That was the
   grounds that they could lean on to have an intermediary to squash the
   beef,” says D.A. Smart, who was a part of Farrakhan’s Fruit of Islam
   security detail and was in attendance at the meeting.

   “No I.D. was in the Nation [of Islam] and Cube was in the Nation at the
   time too. That put both parties in close proximity, where the Nation
   was really feeling like this was something that needed to be squashed,”
   says Dug Infinite, who also attended. “Because not only was this a bad
   reflection on hip-hop, but it was a bad reflection on the Nation.
   Everything that was happening had to be positive at that time.”

   Taking place at the Nation of Islam’s Chicago headquarters, the event
   was populated by Snoop Dogg, Tha Dogg Pound, Bone Thugs ‘N Harmony,
   Channel Live, Nate Dogg, Mack 10, WC, Too $hort, Fat Joe and Chuck D,
   among others. But the highlight of the afternoon — according to those
   in attendance — was Common and Ice Cube’s reconciliation.

   “It even got a little intense. People were expressing themselves,
   wishing to start little arguments, but it was quelled in the presence
   of the Minister. People were starting to take things personal and
   feeling like they had to do something about it outside of music,” says
   Smart. “Farrakhan just broke it down and he killed all of that. At the
   end of his conversation, they were like ‘I’m sorry!’ and ‘My fault, I
   apologize brother!’ (laughs). They squashed the beef and it never came
   back.”
   [1*mWNe4-C0qUO66zAaRXaNOw.jpeg]
   Common and Minister Farrakhan at the peace summit in 1997.

   “Ice Cube pointed out that artists outside of New York were feeling a
   lot of pain because of the continuous rejection from those who
   controlled the media in a city that is deemed as the hip-hop Mecca,”
   longtime Bay Area historian Davey D [21]wrote days after attending the
   event. “He stated that he felt like it would have to be someone of his
   stature to stir things up by taking his course of actions. He said he
   knew there would be a lot of heat on him, however he felt that there
   were a lot of unfair attacks upon West Coast artists… Cube also
   expressed his frustration that he and other West Coast artists would be
   labeled as gangsta rappers who ruined hip hop, while these same critics
   would honor groups like Wu-Tang and Fat Joe who were basically rapping
   about the same subject matter: street life.”

   “Farrakhan was talking to us about how we as a people have been divided
   against one another for far too long. It was time to unify,” says
   Common. “‘All this turf you fighting for — East Coast, West Coast — who
   owns it? Not you.’ He really got through to us.”

   “One of the most compelling and moving moments came when Ice Cube got
   up and hugged Common Sense,” says Davey. “The pair had been feuding on
   records and now realized the type of impact such exchanges can have
   within their communities.”
     __________________________________________________________________

   Despite the fact that things were reconciled between Cube and Common,
   that sentiment didn’t extend between other members of the respective
   camps quite as easily. One year later, Goodie Mob, Fat Joe, Common and
   Mack 10 were tapped for a Voltron-themed Sprite commercial, with each
   rapper representing a region of the United States.

   IFRAME: [22]/media/907fc48e48040b98d69912da6d512b69?postId=1e5ef9deaeba

   “One of my guys was still beefing over the Cube thing,” says Common.
   “When he crossed paths with Mack 10, he grilled him so hard that Mack
   stopped and confronted him.

   “What you looking at, nigga?”

   “I’m looking you in the eye. Chicago niggas look you in the eye.”

   Dug Infinite corroborates this tale.

   “Mack 10 said ‘You’ll lose, here,” says Dug. “Like, ‘Maybe in Chicago
   you can do that.’ Mack 10’s bodyguard stepped up and the guy from
   Chicago called him ‘Wack 10’ and there was some pushing and shoving.”

   Common continues: “Even Cee-Lo was like, ‘Damn, he went in kinda hard
   right there.’ Mack 10 was heated, so he sent one of his boys out to the
   car and he came back with a mag. That’s when Fat Joe intervened, kinda
   like a Mafia don. He pulled me aside and said, ‘Com, ain’t nothing
   gonna happen to you out here, but you gotta check your man. He’s out of
   pocket.’”

   “The guy from Chicago got kicked out of that Sprite commercial shoot
   and went outside and did some damage to Mack 10’s car,” adds Infinite.
   “There was some more fighting and it then it all died down. Later on
   that night at the hotel, Mack 10’s guys came looking for him at the
   hotel in a very street way, I guess packing or whatever.

   “Mack 10 charged Relativity for the damaged car, which my wife — who
   was Common’s assistant A&R at the label — always reminds me of. Like
   ‘What happened?! Why do we have to pay for Mack 10’s car?!?’ That had
   to come out of Common’s budget,” laughs Infinite.

   “I was a little mad at my guy ’cause he was messing with my money at
   that point. We stayed around and shot the video and it was all good
   from there,” says Common.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Despite all of this, twenty years later these events are water under
   the bridge for Common and Ice Cube, who star together in the upcoming
   comedy Barbershop: The Next Cut. They will also star in a new VH1
   “Behind The…” special on April 11th about the gang violence epidemic in
   Chicago. Most recently, the duo collaborated on a single for the
   Barbershop: The Next Cut soundtrack called “Real People.” The song
   directly references their past beef and reconciliation.

   IFRAME: [23]/media/baed4ce69078aafb31e1af8ac7eff583?postId=1e5ef9deaeba

   “I think we’ve been fans of each other from afar. Our beef happened
   because of a misunderstanding. It was cool for us to sit down, talk to
   each other, work that out as men. We’ve been really cool with each
   other for a long time,” Ice Cube [24]revealed recently.

   The fallout from this battle begs the question of whether or not it
   essentially destroyed Cube’s rap career. He was already graduating from
   rapping to acting in the mid-90s, clearly cashing his largest checks
   from Hollywood. So did music matter to him anymore after that first
   handful of classic albums? After he released his
   critically-acclaimed-yet-polarizing Westside Connection full-length
   with WC and Mack 10 in 1996, he returned as a solo artist in 1998 with
   War & Peace Vol. One (The War Disc).

   Abandoning the sample-heavy, golden era styles that made him popular,
   the album was met with poor reviews, despite going platinum. Sure, this
   era would produce two of Cube’s most recognizable modern crossover
   singles — “Pushin’ Weight” and “We Be Clubbin’” — but this pair of
   cheesy, disposable club tracks couldn’t hold a candle to his earlier
   material. It would be two more years before we’d see the gold selling
   War & Peace Vol. 2: The Peace Disc — his last album for Priority
   Records before going independent . Sadly, these albums confirmed what
   Common had told us on “The Bitch In Yoo,” as many fans felt it was too
   late for back-peddling. Something clearly had changed.

   “I think Ice Cube might have been mad at me for [producing] the beat,”
   said Pete Rock. “But I mean, I make beats. It is what it is. It doesn’t
   matter to me if someone wants to use me for a beat to get at somebody.
   What I thought was dumb was saying if you make the beat then you have
   something to do with it. Nah, this is a man who’s gotta get something
   off his chest. If you don’t respect that, then I don’t know what to
   tell you. But I don’t think Ice Cube’s thinking about that anymore. He
   has had a great career.”

   That he has. Despite a period of time when Cube made some questionable
   decisions in the eyes of die-hard rap fans, it hasn’t really tainted
   his legacy— just as one forgettable Paul McCartney solo album doesn’t
   undo the greatness of the rest of his or the Beatles’ catalog. The
   success of 2015’s N.W.A biopic Straight Outta Compton proved that the
   impact of Ice Cube’s career far outshines whatever missteps he might
   have made along the way. People have a whole lot of love for what Cube
   has accomplished, still singing every word to “It Was a Good Day” and
   countless other classics in his catalogue. Now ain’t that a bitch?
