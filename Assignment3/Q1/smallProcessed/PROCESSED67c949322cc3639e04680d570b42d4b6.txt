   The Box Office:

   Suicide Squad opens in North America on Thursday night, where it is
   projected to take in anywhere from $100 million to $140 million its
   debut weekend. So a huge kudos to the marketing team. That's a lot of
   wiggle room, and we'll see whether the mostly negative reviews do any
   real damage. The irony, of course, is that this film, which isn't
   exactly cheap (at least $175m), could gross less than Batman v
   Superman and still be considered a "bigger" success.

   It all depends on word-of-mouth and legs. If the film catches on with
   moviegoers and doesn't collapse after opening weekend, it doesn't have
   to approach that $872m worldwide total to be defined as a success. The
   other side of that equation is that Suicide Squad is a far more
   important film to Warner Bros./Time Warner and DC Comics than it might
   have been had Batman v Superman been better received by critics and
   audiences last Spring.

   This was supposed to be the offbeat offering, but now it is tasked with
   somewhat reenergizing the fanbase and getting general audiences onboard
   for the likes of Wonder Woman, Justice League, and Aquaman. That's some
   heroic heavy lifting for a bunch of bad guys, although history shows
   never to bet against the Joker. And with Harley Quinn making her
   big-screen debut (courtesy of Margot Robbie), this could very well end
   a somewhat disappointing summer with a big bang.

   Okay, that's enough for now. I've written about this film for two
   years, and I'll have plenty more to say when the numbers start rolling
   in. And now onto the review...

   The Review:

   I'm starting to feel like Charlie Brown here, folks. Once again I raced
   toward the football, with every hope that I would get a chance to kick
   it. Once again Lucy has pulled it out from under me at the last minute.
   Here I am, once again flat on my back staring up at the stars,
   wondering how I let myself get duped yet again. If Batman v
   Superman was crushed under the weight of its conflicting goals and
   outsize ambitions, then Suicide Squad merely trips on its own shoelaces
   and barely bothers to get back up.

   This is a film where the first act is made up of the same scene being
   repeated several times. The first time we see Amanda Waller explaining
   to the government that she wants to make a team of supervillains to
   combat metahuman threats is interesting. The fourth or fifth time,
   complete with repeated introductions for the core players (Will Smith
   gets at least three introductory scenes), becomes an unintentional
   comedy. And yet, these moments are the highlight of the film.

   Believe it or not, nearly all of the cool/creepy/offbeat moments
   glimpsed in the trailers are from what amounts to a series of origin
   story flashbacks and related prologue material. It's a marketing scheme
   on par with Paramount/Viacom Inc.'s "[3]Dwayne Johnson punching
   monsters" Hercules campaign, except here the showy flashbacks are the
   best parts of the movie. Once the team lands in harm's way, and with
   the caveat that the plot is already in shambles at this juncture, the
   picture turns into a zombie video game, and not a good one.

   The evil Enchantress (Cara Delevingne, introduced initially with some
   cool horror beats but then stranded in a hellish character with no real
   arc and some ridiculous moments) transforms humans into blob-like
   characters. This allows our Suicide Squad to slash, shoot, and explode
   hordes of adversaries without risking that PG-13. This also means we're
   watching our anti-heroes slaughtering innocent bystanders by the
   truckload. The film never actually comments on that minor detail, but
   it makes the (relatively unexciting) action sequences a lot less fun.

   The would-be action mostly takes place in a few deserted/evacuated city
   streets and an underground locale. The film's third act comes off like
   a cross between Ghostbusters and The Mummy Returns but sans any earned
   character loyalty or rising tension. For all the hub-bub about the bad
   guys being the heroes, their "evil" background is almost irrelevant for
   the course of this specific story. The fact that these guys and gals
   are villains is almost beside the point since they never actually
   engage in any skullduggery while on the mission.

   To be fair, many of the team members are relegated to background
   players. Will Smith's Deadshot, Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, and Joel
   Kinnaman's Rick Flag (who is a good guy put in charge of the bad guys)
   take center stage. Jay Hernandez's Diablo gets a tragic backstory
   (albeit one that involves icky stereotypes and hardcore fridging), and
   Viola Davis almost steals the picture before she mostly disappears in
   the second half. The rest of the cast (Adam Beach, Jai Courtney, etc.)
   mostly fades into the background. This really is a Will Smith vehicle
   with a few colorful supporting characters.

   Fortunately, Will Smith gives a real movie star performance, and he
   came to play. And yes, there is a certain "connected universe" thrill
   in an early flashback where he interacts with Ben Affleck's Batman.
   Margot Robbie has as much fun as she can even though it's not her movie
   no matter how much we might wish otherwise. She's a firecracker to be
   sure, but she is frankly underused considering how much her character
   brings to the table. The film doesn't even try to scratch the surface
   regarding her would-be relationship with you-know-who.

   Speaking of which, Jared Leto's Joker is barely in the movie, which is
   both a good thing and a bad thing. Leto's perfectly okay turn doesn't
   do much beyond mimicking James Cagney combined with a modern day
   gangster persona, and it's nice that he isn't allowed to take over the
   movie. But considering how weak the main villains turn out to be, it is
   almost a pity that Ayer didn't just make Mr. J the primary antagonist
   for narrative efficiency. For what it's worth, I'm guessing a lot of
   Joker/Harley stuff ended up on the cutting room floor.

   The majority of the film is such a slog of "anti-heroes shooting at CGI
   blobs" and "anti-heroes slowly walking through a deserted cityscape"
   that you almost look forward to Leto's periodic Swiper-like appearances
   just for the change in scenery. The film is clearly a victim of
   [4]post-production tinkering and reshoots. There are plenty of moments
   in the trailer that aren't in the movie, there are conflicting
   expository details, and the whole picture has a sense of forced whimsy.
   The non-stop soundtrack seems to operate as glorified duct tape for
   what became the final cut. I really wish studios would stop sabotaging
   their own films (at great expense) for the sake of a theoretically more
   crowdpleasing version.

   Suicide Squad is not the savior of the summer. It is not the great DC
   Films entry that gets the franchise back on track after two middling
   Zack Snyder-directed Superman movies. It is a narratively slapdash
   affair, filled with dull action beats, a zig-zag plot with no suspense
   and no tension, plus a constant stream of musical choices that often
   feel about as subtle as that one great scene in Baseketball. The only
   things worth savoring are Smith, Robbie, and Davis. They make the case
   for their inclusion in a better DC Films project down the line.

   Ah, a better DC Films project... Once upon a time I bent over backward
   to be fair to Green Lantern, yet now I am nostalgic for what that
   film's A-to-B-to-C competence. As much as everyone talked about Zack
   Snyder as the great devil holding back the DC Comics universe, Suicide
   Squad is noticeably inferior to Man of Steel and Batman v Superman.
   It's (perhaps by default) probably the worst "big" DC Comics
   live-action movie since Catwoman. Even Jonah Hex, warts and all, was at
   least about something, as its "fear of a militarized Tea Party" subtext
   turned out to be sadly prescient.

   With [5]Batman: Assault on Arkham providing a proverbial blueprint on
   how to do a Suicide Squad movie, there is no excuse for this. So here
   we are, with another devastating letdown from the newfangled DC Films
   universe. I am a lifelong DC Comics fan, one who spent his teen years
   filled with excitement for Batman Returns and Batman Forever. Now I
   look at the likes of Wonder Woman, Justice League, and Aquaman with
   fear and trepidation. I still hope, but only because I cannot bear to
   be in a position of not looking forward to a friggin' Justice
   League movie.

   I would love for Wonder Woman to be the Captain America of the DC Films
   world, that instant classic right before the big, big show. But at this
   juncture, I'd settle for a DC (theatrical) live-action movie at least
   as good as Thor. I mean, they've got nowhere to go but up, right? To
   paraphrase another comic book franchise, I need me to hope again...
