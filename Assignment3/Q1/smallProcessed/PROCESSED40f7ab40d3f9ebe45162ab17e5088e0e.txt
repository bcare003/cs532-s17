   WWE Smackdown Live

      Daniel Bryan confirmed the main event of tonight’s WWE Smackdown Live
      will feature Bray Wyatt defending his title against John Cena and AJ
      Styles in a triple threat match.

      The title bout was originally scheduled to feature Cena challenging
      Wyatt in a singles match, but AJ Styles came out and made a case that
      he still deserved a title rematch first. Cena and Styles were in the
      ring as Bryan came out and heard both arguments, then determined they
      would all compete in a triple threat tonight.
