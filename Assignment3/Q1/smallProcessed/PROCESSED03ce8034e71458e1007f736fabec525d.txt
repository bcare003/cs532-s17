   As Mojo Rawley prepared for the opening match of WWE Elimination
   Chamber last Sunday in Phoenix, he had to make sure his guests for the
   night were squared away with their tickets. While his good friend and
   New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkwoski was still back east
   celebrating the Patriots' Super Bowl LI win, Rawley left two tickets to
   the show for Gronkowski's father, Gordon, and brother, Dan, who sat
   ringside for the show.

   "They have business in Phoenix next week, but they flew in early
   because they wanted to see me," Rawley said. "They're like family to
   me."

     - WWE (@WWE) [96]December 30, 2015

   Rawley, whose real name is Dean Muhtadi, was a defensive lineman at
   Maryland and a teammate of Dan and Chris Gronkowski. By the time he
   graduated in 2009, he had become an extended part of the Gronkowski
   family.

   "They're my best friends," Rawley said. "Big G, Papa Gronk -- he calls
   me his sixth son, and I call him my second dad. We all grew up together
   before anyone achieved any kind of level of success. We push each
   other. We talk to each other every day. It's one of those things where
   I'll see Rob busting a move after a big game and the rest of us are
   like, 'We got to catch up with Big Rob,' and then Rob will come to one
   of my matches and he'll be all amped up and say, 'I got to step my game
   up, too.' That's just kind of our relationship."

   Dean Muhtadi would never have become Mojo Rawley had it not been for
   Gordon Gronkowski, who was college roommates with Mike Rotunda at
   Syracuse, where they both played football. Rotunda just so happens to
   be former WWE superstar I.R.S. (and the father of new WWE champion Bray
   Wyatt).

   "Big G is how I got my job here," Rawley said. "He knew I wanted to be
   here and I was always a fan, but I didn't have any idea of how to
   actually get here. I just thought it was some unreachable, unattainable
   goal I had. I mean, how do you get to the WWE? Well, one day Big G and
   Mr. Rotunda had a conversation about me and Mr. Rotunda seemed
   intrigued by who I was, and a couple phone calls later I had my
   opportunity. I've always said just give me an opportunity and I'm going
   to make the most of it."

   Rawley is holding out hope that he can do more than repay the
   Gronkowski family with tickets to a pay-per-view. His goal is to one
   day have them be part of a match and maybe even convince Rob to get in
   the ring with him.

   "Rob has been a fan of the WWE for a long time," Rawley said. "Trust
   me, we've been talking about this for years and whenever the time is
   right and whenever the stars are aligned, I can tell you he will be
   raring to get over here. He's fired up doing something with me here at
   WWE, and I can't wait to have him. We've been dreaming about it for
   years"

   expected to get another chance with the WWE, but she's taking full
   advantage of her second run with the company. Vaughn Ridley for ESPN

The return of Mickie James

   Mickie James still walks around the backstage area at WWE shows with
   the smile of someone reliving a dream she thought had died long ago.
   James was released from the WWE on April 22, 2010, and she has spent
   much of the past seven years competing in independent promotions and
   wrestling in venues ranging from high school gyms to studio sound
   stages.

    [101]Rule No. 8: An announcer needs to get the on-air talents over
       Wrestling commentary can make all the difference in the world and
       Gordon Solie set the bar high for how to truly push an angle
       without stepping foot in the ring.

   "It's pretty incredible to be back, it's not what I expected at all.
   It's funny how things happen in life," James said. "I had pretty much
   accepted the fact I was going to be a stay-at-home mom and do my other
   adventures in life. I thought coming back to the WWE was out of the
   cards for me. It's weird how things work out, but it has been amazing.
   The fans have been great, and so receptive."

   James was re-signed by the WWE last October, made a one-off appearance
   at NXT TakeOver: Toronto against Asuka, and made her return to the main
   roster on SmackDown last month. As she prepared for her first WWE
   pay-per-view match in almost seven years last Sunday, she smiled and
   shook her head when thinking about performing in front of a sold-out
   arena and a worldwide audience again.

   "It's very humbling when you leave here and you've wrestled in front of
   sold-out crowds of as many as 90,000 people, to go back to square one,"
   James said. "I came from the independent scene and I've wrestled in
   front of a crowd of four people in a car lot in 104 degrees in
   Fayetteville, North Carolina. It's very humbling when you have to go
   backwards and after doing it for a bit, I was sitting there and
   debating with myself about what I should do. I don't want to retire on
   the independent scene. I don't want my legacy to be remembered as that.
   I wasn't sure whether it was time to walk away, but I didn't want to be
   remembered in that way."

   James was a five-time WWE women's champion during her first stint with
   the company, second only to Trish Stratus in total number of reigns,
   and feuded with current WWE Hall of Famers such as Stratus, Lita and
   Jacqueline. She's hoping her current WWE run ends in similar fashion to
   all three of those women -- with an induction of her own at some point
   in the near future.

   "I've been doing this close to 19 years now and I always dreamed of
   being in the WWE," James said. "So when you leave and come back you
   want your legacy to be something positive and helped change the
   business in a good way. I'm very happy to see people I know and have
   worked with and admire get into the Hall of Fame, and that's obviously
   one of those things we all secretly hope for. That would be pretty
   awesome. It's an acknowledgement of everything that you did and
   sacrificed and gave to the company, and a chance to acknowledge
   everything they gave to you, too."

   might have lost in his first major political election, but he has
   remained very active in local Michigan politics. @WWE

Rhyno's political aspirations

   In the wrestling ring, Rhyno is a two-time ECW champion and, more
   recently, one-half of the first WWE SmackDown tag team champions. But
   outside of the squared circle, Terrance Guido Gerin just wanted to
   represent Dearborn, Michigan, by becoming a state representative for
   the 15th District.

   Gerin won the Republican primary in his run for the Michigan House of
   Representatives last year, but he fell a little over 8,000 votes shy of
   defeating Democratic primary winner Abdullah Hammoud in November's
   general election.

   "One of the great things about me running is I became closer to my
   community," Gerin said. "When you're knocking on doors and explaining
   your views and asking for their vote, you're asking for something big.
   I really wanted to be a leader and champion on the next level in my
   community. I've never gone door to door like that, but I'm a people
   person. Every week I put myself out there in front of millions of
   people worldwide wearing spandex. So I have no problem putting myself
   out there."

   If Gerin had won, he said he wouldn't have necessarily taken a break
   from the WWE. He would have worked with the company to be both a pro
   wrestler and a state representative, which could have made for some
   interesting storylines in and out of the ring.

   "They said they would have worked with me 100 percent," Gerin said.
   "The WWE feels whenever you're trying to do something in a positive
   light to help out your community -- they always are appreciative of
   that. They were definitely willing to work around my schedule. I may
   not have been able to do all the shows but I definitely would still be
   part of the WWE family."

   Gerin, who still attends city council meetings and watches them online
   if he can't be there in person, is once again focused on wrestling
   after his first political loss. But he said he can't completely rule
   out another role or another run for political office at some point in
   the near future.

   "If I said no, I won't run, I think I would be lying to myself," Gerin
   said. "I want to be part of something bigger than myself, not only in
   wrestling or in the WWE but on the level of helping out my country and
   my community. So we'll see what happens."
