WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:

   On Tuesday, after 24 hours of debate from Democratic Senators on the
   Senate floor, Republican and Democratic Senators met to vote on Betsy
   DeVos’ nomination for Secretary of the Department of Education.
   DeVos, nominated by Donald Trump, has had a rocky road to confirmation.
   At her Senate confirmation hearing, DeVos was criticized for her views
   regarding public education including her lack of understanding
   regarding federal protections for students with disabilities. Prior to
   voting, Republican Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski
   (R-AK), announced they would not vote for DeVos, putting the
   anticipated vote at 50 for and 50 against. (To be confirmed, DeVos
   needed a simple majority, 51 Senators, to vote in her favor.)
   Wednesday’s final Senate vote was tied with 50 voting for and 50
   against.
