Behind the Cinematography of the Oscar-Nominated Movie Moonlight

   [16]Paul Moakley
   Feb 22, 2017

   This weekend at the Oscars, cinematographer James Laxton is up for his
   first Academy Award for his work on the drama Moonlight. The film and
   its visuals developed from a deep collaboration with his college
   friend, screenwriter and director Barry Jenkins, that date back to when
   they met 17 years ago at Florida State University. Since that time the
   duo developed a very personal aesthetic their work inspired by fine art
   photography and indie cinema.

   Laxton, who says he first started talking about this movie with Jenkins
   years ago, breaks down the anatomy of the film's pivotal scenes and
   reveals the who inspired the distinct look of Moonlight.
