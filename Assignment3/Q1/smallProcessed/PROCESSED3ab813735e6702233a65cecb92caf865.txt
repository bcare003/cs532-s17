   WWE's annual banner event, WrestleMania, is a sports entertainment
   mainstay that has captivated audiences while drawing record attendance
   records for years. It is easy to say that WrestleMania is up there with
   the Super Bowl in terms of fan interest.

   So it's not out of the ordinary to see that many professional
   wrestlers, in and out of WWE, are always interested in a big match at
   WrestleMania. Count TNA wrestler and Bellator MMA fighter Bobby
   Lashley, a former WWE superstar, among those who are pining for a big
   match at professional wrestling's biggest event.

   Lashley was a guest on a recent edition of 'The Ross Report', Jim Ross'
   podcast, where he was promotion this Sunday’s TNA Bound For Glory
   pay-per-view and his next fight in Bellator MMA against Josh Appelt on
   October 21st.

   The conversation turned to a potential Lashley/Brock Lesnar fight at
   WrestleMania:

     "You know, I hear that all the time, and J.R., you know as well as I
     do, it’s not in my hands. If you ask me, I would say absolutely, but
     it’s the powers that be. I think that there’s enough fans who would
     love to see it. They’ve been saying it from day one. And you know
     what the funny thing about it is? I’ve never met Brock in person.
     Never crossed paths with Brock anywhere. So we don’t even know each
     other at all, whatsoever.

     And I’ve always been compared to Brock, and they say ‘Are you and
     Brock gonna fight? Are you and Brock gonna wrestle? I don’t know if
     the fighting is still an opportunity with me being in Bellator and
     him kind of being with the UFC; or I don’t know what the situation
     is right now. So I don’t know if the fight thing is possible, but to
     see me as Brock’s destroying everyone and save the day, or vice
     versa, whatever the case is, have us stand face to face? I think the
     crowd would go insane. And there’s a tremendous amount of money in
     it. If it were to happen, then I’m open for it."

   There is no doubting the big money behind a Lashley/Lesnar match and
   things will get much more interesting if WWE ends up finalizing a deal
   to purchase TNA.

   Lashley would likely be one of a handful of TNA talents that WWE would
   retain and it would allow WWE the opportunity to book a megafight
   between Lesnar and Lashley, one that won't need much build outside a
   staredown.

   If WWE buys TNA, this is one story that fans will need to keep a close
   eye on.
