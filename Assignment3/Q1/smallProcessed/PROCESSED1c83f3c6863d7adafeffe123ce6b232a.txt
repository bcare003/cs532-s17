Roman Reigns' US Title Loss on Raw Sets Up Championship Win at WWE Royal

   Roman Reigns losing the United States Championship to Chris Jericho on
   Monday’s episode of Raw will make a portion of the WWE Universe happy,
   but dropping the title could be a sign of bigger things to come.

   At the 2017 Royal Rumble, Reigns is now poised to beat Kevin Owens for
   the Universal Championship and head into WrestleMania 33 with the
   title.

   WWE Creative has shown an unwavering support for Reigns, and losing a
   secondary championship ahead of the Royal Rumble may be enough to throw
   people off the scent of a possible title change.

   Instead of viewing it as Reigns losing the U.S. title, optimists will
   see it as him taking one step back in order to take two steps forward.
   For pessimists, the booking Monday has all the earmarks of a Superstar
   dropping one title in order to win something more important.

   Something like the Universal Championship.

   A believable storyline for Owens losing to Reigns is already in place
   with Jericho suspended high above the ring in a shark cage during their
   title match in San Antonio. There will inevitably be
   interference—likely Y2J dropping something down to Owens—but Reigns
   could reverse the attack and beat Owens using his own underhanded
   tactics against him.

   Not only would Owens losing at the Royal Rumble give Reigns the
   Universal Championship, but it also builds to the inevitable Jericho
   vs. Owens matchup the WWE Universe is eagerly anticipating. Now instead
   of the feud being for the Universal Championship, it could be centered
   on the U.S. title, which would bring prestige back to the belt.

   Reigns winning the Universal Championship would also set up perfectly
   for the winner of the 30-man Battle Royal to challenge him at
   WrestleMania 33. Whether it’s The Undertaker, Goldberg, Brock Lesnar,
   Braun Strowman, Seth Rollins or any of the other top contenders, Reigns
   fighting the Royal Rumble winner for the title would be a marquee
   matchup.

   Of all the options for Royal Rumble winners who could challenge Reigns,
   Rollins is the most interesting from a storyline perspective. As
   friends, Rollins winning the Royal Rumble and challenging Reigns for
   the championship would be an interesting dynamic, but the storyline
   with Triple H still lingers in the background.

   In a moment of poetic justice, Reigns could finally embrace the dark
   side and turn heel at WrestleMania, siding with Triple H and beating
   Rollins using the help of The Authority.

   Regardless of who wins the annual Battle Royal, Reigns' loss on
   Monday’s episode of Raw leaves the door wide open for him to walk out
   of the Royal Rumble with the Universal Championship.

   After how WWE has protected his character in recent months, it’s hard
   to bet against him.
