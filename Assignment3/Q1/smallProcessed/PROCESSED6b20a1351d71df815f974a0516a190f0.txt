   Figure 1. Because raccoons manipulate and moisten food items in water,
   there is a misconception that raccoons “wash” their food before eating
   it. However, when water is not available, raccoons use many of the same
   motions in handling food. (Photo by Ginger Holser)

   The raccoon (Procyon lotor) is a native mammal, measuring about 3 feet
   long, including its 12-inch, bushy, ringed tail. Because their hind
   legs are longer than the front legs, raccoons have a hunched appearance
   when they walk or run. Each of their front feet has five dexterous
   toes, allowing raccoons to grasp and manipulate food and other items
   (Fig. 1).

   Raccoons prefer forest areas near a stream or water source, but have
   adapted to various environments throughout Washington. Raccoon
   populations can get quite large in urban areas, owing to hunting and
   trapping restrictions, few predators, and human-supplied food.

   Adult raccoons weigh 15 to 40 pounds, their weight being a result of
   genetics, age, available food, and habitat location. Males have weighed
   in at over 60 pounds. A raccoon in the wild will probably weigh less
   than the urbanized raccoon that has learned to live on handouts, pet
   food, and garbage-can leftovers.

   As long as raccoons are kept out of human homes, not cornered, and not
   treated as pets, they are not dangerous.

   Facts about Washington Raccoons

     Food and Feeding Habitats
     * Raccoons will eat almost anything, but are particularly fond of
       creatures found in water—clams, crayfish, frogs, fish, and snails.
     * Raccoons also eat insects, slugs, dead animals, birds and bird
       eggs, as well as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Around
       humans, raccoons often eat garbage and pet food.
     * Although not great hunters, raccoons can catch young gophers,
       squirrels, mice, and rats.
     * Except during the breeding season and for females with young,
       raccoons are solitary. Individuals will eat together if a large
       amount of food is available in an area.

     Den Sites and Resting Sites
     * Dens are used for shelter and raising young. They include abandoned
       burrows dug by other mammals, areas in or under large rock piles
       and brush piles, hollow logs, and holes in trees.
     * Den sites also include wood duck nest-boxes, attics, crawl spaces,
       chimneys, and abandoned vehicles.
     * In urban areas, raccoons normally use den sites as daytime rest
       sites. In wooded areas, they often rest in trees.
     * Raccoons generally move to different den or daytime rest site every
       few days and do not follow a predictable pattern. Only a female
       with young or an animal “holed up” during a cold spell will use the
       same den for any length of time. Several raccoons may den together
       during winter storms.

     Reproduction and Home Range
     * Raccoons pair up only during the breeding season, and mating occurs
       as early as January to as late as June. The peak mating period is
       March to April.
     * After a 65-day gestation period, two to three kits are born.
     * The kits remain in the den until they are about seven weeks old, at
       which time they can walk, run, climb, and begin to occupy alternate
       dens.
     * At eight to ten weeks of age, the young regularly accompany their
       mother outside the den and forage for them selves. By 12 weeks, the
       kits roam on their own for several nights before returning to their
       mother.
     * The kits remain with their mother in her home range through winter,
       and in early spring seek out their own territories.
     * The size of a raccoon’s home range as well as its nightly hunting
       area varies greatly depending on the habitat and food supply. Home
       range diameters of 1 mile are known to occur in urban areas.

     Mortality and Longevity
     * Raccoons die from encounters with vehicles, hunters, and trappers,
       and from disease, starvation, and predation.
     * Young raccoons are the main victims of starvation, since they have
       very little fat reserves to draw from during food shortages in late
       winter and early spring.
     * Raccoon predators include cougars, bobcats, coyotes, and domestic
       dogs. Large owls and eagles will prey on young raccoons.
     * The average life span of a raccoon in the wild is 2 to 3 years;
       captive raccoons have lived 13.

   Viewing Raccoons

     Raccoons can be seen throughout the year, except during extremely
     cold periods. Usually observed at night, they are occasionally seen
     during the day eating or napping in a tree or searching elsewhere
     for food. Coastal raccoons take advantage of low tides and are seen
     foraging on shellfish and other food by day.

     Trails

     Raccoons use trails made by other wildlife or humans next to creeks,
     ravines, ponds, and other water sources. Raccoons often use culverts
     as a safe way to cross under roads. With a marsh on one side of the
     road and woods on the other, a culvert becomes their chief route
     back and forth. Look for raccoon tracks in sand, mud, or soft soil
     at either end of the culvert.

     In developed areas, raccoon travel along fences, next to buildings,
     and near food sources.

                                                      [57][t_raccoon2.jpg]

Figure 2. The rear foot of a raccoon shows the “heel” and looks like a
       small human footprint. Both front and back feet have five toes. The
      front prints have shorter heel marks and are 2 to 3 inches long; the
                                       hind tracks are 3 to 4 inches long.
         (From Pandell and Stall, Animal Tracks of the Pacific Northwest.)

     Tracks, Scratch Marks,
     and Similar Signs

     Look for tracks in sand, mud, or soft soil, also on deck railings,
     fire escapes, and other surfaces that raccoons use to gain access to
     structures (Fig. 2). Tracks may appear as smudge marks on the side
     of a house where a raccoon shimmies up and down a downspout or
     utility pipe.

     Sharp, nonretractable claws and long digits make raccoons good
     climbers. Like squirrels, raccoons can rotate their hind feet 180
     degrees and descend trees headfirst. (Cats’ claws don’t rotate and
     they have to back down trees.) Look for scratch marks on trees and
     other structures that raccoons climb.

     Look for wear marks, body oil, and hairs on wood and other rough
     surfaces, particularly around the edges of den entrances. The den’s
     entrance hole is usually at least 4 inches high and 6 inches wide.

     Droppings

     Raccoon droppings are crumbly, flat-ended, and can contain a variety
     of food items. The length is 3 to 5 inches, but this is usually
     broken into segments. The diameter is about the size of the end of
     your little finger.

     Raccoons leave droppings on logs, at the base of trees, and on roofs
     (raccoons defecate before climbing trees and entering structures).
     Raccoons create toilet areas—inside and outside structures—away from
     the nesting area. House cats have similar habits.

     Note: Raccoon droppings may carry a parasite that can be fatal to
     humans. Do not handle or smell raccoon droppings and wash your hands
     if you touch any. (See "[58]Public Health Concerns" )

     Calls

     Raccoons make several types of noises, including a purr, a
     chittering sound, and various growls, snarls, and snorts.

                       Raccoons —Too Close for Comfort

   If a raccoon ever approaches too closely, make yourself appear larger:
     stand up if sitting, shout, and wave your arms. If necessary, throw
    stones or send the raccoon off with a dousing of water from a hose or
                                   bucket.

     If a raccoon continues to act aggressively or strangely (circling,
   staggering as if drunk or disoriented, or shows unnatural tameness) it
    may be sick or injured. In such a case, call a wildlife rehabilitator
    (see [59]Wildlife Rehabilitators and Wildlife Rehabilitation) or your
                          [60]WDFW Regional Office.

    If aggressive raccoons are routinely seen in your area, prepare your
     children for a possible encounter. Explain the reasons why raccoons
   live there (habitat, food sources, species adaptability) and what they
   should do if one approaches them. By shouting a set phrase such as “Go
   away raccoon!” when they encounter one, instead of a general scream,
       children will inform nearby adults of the raccoon’s presence.
       Demonstrate and rehearse encounter behavior with the children.

        If a raccoon finds its way into your house, stay calm, close
   surrounding interior doors, leave the room, and let the animal find its
   way back out through the open door, window, or pet door. If necessary,
     gently use a broom to corral the raccoon outside. (Do not corner a
               raccoon, thereby forcing it to defend itself.)

   Preventing Conflicts

   A raccoon’s search for food may lead it to a vegetable garden, fish
   pond, garbage can, or chicken coop. Its search for a den site may lead
   it to an attic, chimney, or crawl space. The most effective way to
   prevent conflicts is to modify the habitat around your home so as not
   to attract raccoons. Recommendations on how to do this are given below:

     Don’t feed raccoons.
     Feeding raccoons may create undesirable situations for you, your
     children, neighbors, pets, and the raccoons themselves. Raccoons
     that are fed by people often lose their fear of humans and may
     become aggressive when not fed as expected. Artificial feeding also
     tends to concentrate raccoons in a small area; overcrowding can
     spread diseases and parasites. Finally, these hungry visitors might
     approach a neighbor who doesn’t share your appreciation of the
     animals. The neighbor might choose to remove these raccoons, or have
     them removed.

     Don’t give raccoons access to garbage.
     Keep your garbage can lid on tight by securing it with rope, chain,
     bungee cords, or weights. Better yet, buy garbage cans with clamps
     or other mechanisms that hold lids on. To prevent tipping, secure
     side handles to metal or wooden stakes driven into the ground. Or
     keep your cans in tight-fitting bins, a shed, or a garage. Put
     garbage cans out for pickup in the morning, after raccoons have
     returned to their resting areas.

     Feed dogs and cats indoors and keep them in at night.
     If you must feed your pets outside, do so in late morning or at
     midday, and pick up food, water bowls, leftovers, and spilled food
     well before dark every day.

     Keep pets indoors at night.
     If cornered, raccoons may attack dogs and cats. Bite wounds from
     raccoons can result in fractures and disease transmission.

     Prevent raccoons from entering pet doors.
     Keep indoor pet food and any other food away from a pet door. Lock
     the pet door at night. If it is necessary to have it remain open,
     put an electronically activated opener on your pet’s collar. Note:
     Floodlights or motion detector lights placed above the pet door to
     scare raccoons are not long-term solutions.

     Put food in secure compost containers and clean up barbecue areas.
     Don’t put food of any kind in open compost piles; instead, use a
     securely covered compost structure or a commercially available
     raccoon-proof composter to prevent attracting raccoons and getting
     exposed to their droppings. A covered worm box is another
     alternative. If burying food scraps, cover them with at least 8
     inches of soil and don’t leave any garbage above ground in the
     area—including the stinky shovel. Placing a wire mesh barrier that
     is held in place with a heavy object over the in-ground compost will
     prevent problems.

     Clean barbecue grills and grease traps thoroughly following each
     use.

     Eliminate access to denning sites.
     Raccoons commonly use chimneys, attics, and spaces under houses,
     porches, and sheds as den sites. Close any potential entries with
     ¼-inch mesh hardware cloth, boards, or metal flashing. Make all
     connections flush and secure to keep mice, rats, and other mammals
     out. Make sure you don’t trap an animal inside when you seal off a
     potential entry (see [61]Evicting Animals from Buildings). For
     information on securing chimneys, see "[62]Raccoons in Dumpsters and
     Down Chimneys".

    Figure 3. Raccoon access to rooftops can be eliminated by installing
   sheets of aluminum flashing, at least 3 feet square, around the corners
                                of buildings.
   Figure 4. Commercially available metal or plastic spikes can help keep
           raccoons off of buildings. (Drawings by Jenifer Rees.)

     Prevent raccoons from accessing rooftops by trimming tree limbs away
     from structures and by attaching sheets of metal flashing around
     corners of buildings (Fig. 3). Commercial products that prevent
     climbing are available from farm supply centers and bird-control
     supply companies on the Internet (Fig. 4). Remove vegetation on
     buildings, such as English ivy, which provide raccoons a way to
     climb structures and hide their access point inside.

                    Raccoons in Dumpsters and Down Chimneys

      Raccoons are enticed by the food smells in dumpsters. When the lids are
      open they climb in and can’t climb the slippery sides to get out. To
      help them escape, put a strong branch or board in the dumpster for the
                             raccoons to climb out on.

        If your disposal company leaves dumpster lids open, install a sign
       telling employees that it’s vital to keep the lid closed so animals
        don’t get trapped inside. Consider installing a totally enclosed
        trash-compacting dumpster. The trash is deposited in the front and
                               regularly compacted.

       In spring and summer, a female raccoon may be enticed into the dark,
        quiet, and secure environment of your chimney for a nesting place.

        If you hear a large animal on the roof, or growls and whines coming
       from the chimney at night, there is probably a raccoon family inside.
      Using a powerful flashlight during the day, look for a raccoon down the
         chimney. (If spider webs are strung across the inside, you can be
               reasonably sure that no animal is using the chimney.)

      The easiest solution to removing raccoons from a chimney is to wait for
        them to move on their own. After eight to ten weeks the female and
                         young will leave and not return.

       If raccoons need to be evicted, do not smoke them out and do not pour
        anything, including naphtha flakes or mothballs, down the chimney.
     Adult raccoons can easily climb out of a chimney, but the babies can’t.
       The concentrated vapors can also damage the infant raccoons’ mucous
      membranes and make an adult raccoon extremely agitated while attempting
                             to flee from the vapors.

        Instead, harass the adult female using the following methods until
       being there is no longer worth her effort. She will move her young to
       an alternate den, one by one, holding them by the back of the neck in
      her mouth. Note: Any time you try to evict any mother animal, there is
           a chance that she may leave some or all of the babies behind.

                     To encourage the female raccoon to leave:

        1. Keep the chimney damper closed and put a loud radio tuned to a
        talk station in the fireplace.

        2.With a short broomstick, pole, or board, bang on the underside of
        the damper as frequently as possible.

        3.Wearing gloves, sprinkle coyote urine or raccoon eviction fluid
        (available from farm supply centers, hunting stores, and the
        Internet) on a rag and wedge it in above the damper. If none of
        these natural repellents are available, place a bowl containing a
        cup of ammonia on a footstool just under the damper. If needed, open
        the damper 1/8-inch. Most dampers are not airtight. Keep what
        deterrents you can in place 24 hours a day during a period of mild
        weather, and give the raccoons two to three nights to move out. On
        the night of departure there may be a lot of racket caused by the
        female raccoon’s frequent climbing up and down the chimney as she
        retrieves her young.


                                                    [66][t_raccoon5.jpg]
     Figure 5. A commercially available chimney cap will prevent raccoons
   and other small animals from entering the chimney. (Drawing by Jenifer
                                                                   Rees.)

      In urban areas, harassment techniques may not work owing to raccoons’
      familiarity with humans. In such cases, call a wildlife damage control
       company and have them assess the situation (see [67]Hiring a Wildlife
                             Damage Control Company).

        To make sure the eviction process was successful, shine a powerful
       flashlight down the chimney during the day and look for raccoons. Tap
       the chimney with a hard object and listen for any sounds of movement.
         If a young raccoon is left behind, it may be that the mother has
      abandoned it. In these rare cases it is best to hire a wildlife damage
                       control company to remove the animal.

      Once the raccoons are gone, promptly call a professional chimney sweep
          to remove any debris and to install a commercially designed and
        engineered chimney cap (homemade caps are often unsafe and may be a
      fire hazard). You can still have fires in your fireplace; however, the
           “cap” will keep raccoons and other wildlife out (Fig. 5).

     Enclose poultry (chickens, ducks, and turkeys) in a secure outdoor
     pen and house.
     Raccoons will eat poultry and their eggs if they can get to them.
     Signs of raccoon predation include the birds’ heads bitten off and
     left some distance away, only the bird’s crop being eaten, stuck
     birds pulled half-way through a fence, and nests in severe disarray.
     Note: Other killers of poultry include coyotes, foxes, skunks, feral
     cats, dogs, bobcats, opossums, weasels, eagles, hawks, owls, other
     poultry, and disease.

     If a dead bird is found with no apparent injuries, skinning it may
     determine what killed it. If the carcass is patterned by red spots
     where pointed teeth have bruised the flesh but not broken the skin,
     the bird was probably “played with” by one or more dogs until it
     died.

                                                       [68][t_raccoon6.jpg]
      Figure 6. Install two electrified wires, 12 and 18 inches above ground
              and onto existing fence posts, poultry pen supports, and other
     structures, using the proper insulators. A single strand of wire may be
          sufficient, but two wires will provide added insurance against the
        animal making the climb. Run one or two electrified wires toward the
      top of the fence to prevent bobcats and other species from jumping the
            lower hot wires and making the climb. (Drawing by Jenifer Rees.)

     To prevent raccoons and other animals from accessing birds in their
     night roosts, equip poultry houses with well-fitted doors and secure
     locking mechanisms. A raccoon’s dexterous paws make it possible for
     it to open various types of fasteners, latches, and containers.

     To prevent raccoons and other animals from accessing poultry during
     the day, completely enclose outdoor pens with 1-inch chicken wire
     placed over a sturdy wooden framework. Overlap and securely wire all
     seams on top to prevent raccoons from forcing their way in by using
     their weight and claws. To prevent raccoons from reaching in at
     ground level, surround the bottom 18 inches of the pen with
     smaller-mesh wire.

     See Figures 3, 4, 6 for examples of how to prevent raccoons from
     climbing enclosures. (See "[69]Preventing Conflicts" in Skunks for
     examples of how to prevent raccoons from digging into enclosures.)

     Fence orchards and vegetable gardens.
     Raccoons can easily climb wood or wire fences, or bypass them by
     using overhanging limbs of trees or shrubs. See Figures 6 and 8 for
     examples of ways to prevent raccoons from climbing fences and
     accessing crops at ground level. Wire fences will need to have a
     mesh size that is no wider than 3 inches to keep young raccoons out.
     (See "[70]Electric Fences" in Deer for additional information.)

     Protect fruit trees, bird feeders, and nest boxes.
     To prevent raccoons from climbing fruit trees, poles, and other
     vertical structures, install a metal or heavy plastic barrier (Fig.
     7). Twenty-four-inch long aluminum or galvanized vent-pipe,
     available at most hardware stores, can serve as a premade barrier
     around a narrow support. (See [71]Tree Squirrels for more examples.)
     Note: Raccoons will attempt to use surrounding trees or structures
     as an avenue to access the area above the barrier.

     Alternatively, a funnel-shaped piece of aluminum flashing can be
     fitted around the tree or other vertical structure. The outside edge
     of the flared metal should be a minimum of 18 inches away from the
     support. Cut the material with tin snips and file down any sharp
     edges.

     [72][t_raccoon7a.jpg]                        [73][t_raccoon7b.jpg]
     Figure 7. A raccoon guard can be secured around trees, pipes, posts,
      and other structures to keep raccoons from climbing. It can be made
     from a piece of aluminum flashing or sheet metal, held together with
     wire, nails, or screws, and painted to blend in. (Drawing by Jenifer
                                                                  Rees.)

     Regularly pick up fallen birdseed and fruit to prevent attracting
     raccoons.

     Discourage raccoons from disturbing pond plants and other aquatic
     life.
     Raccoons are attracted to ponds because they associate them with a
     food source. While a motion-activated light or sprinkler, or your
     shouting may scare off a raccoon, this is usually temporary. A
     raccoon, especially an urban raccoon, may run away the first night,
     walk away the second night, but, if there’s no additional deterrent,
     by the third or fourth night the animal will be back with the light
     shining brightly or the sprinkler sprinkling strongly.

     Always give fish a safe place to hide by constructing hiding places
     on the bottom of the pond. Use cinder blocks, ceramic drain tile,
     wire baskets, or upside-down plastic crates held in place with heavy
     rocks.

     To prevent raccoons from disturbing aquatic plants in containers,
     use containers that are too heavy or wide for raccoons to overturn.
     Securing chicken wire over the top of the containers will prevent
     raccoons from disturbing the soil inside.

     Although it’s awkward looking, small ponds can be completely covered
     with a barrier that can be left on permanently or removed daily.

     Since raccoons are most active after dark, be sure the pond is
     covered at night. Examples of barriers include one-inch mesh chicken
     wire laid over the surface and held in place with stakes—raccoons
     will walk on the barrier and try and go under it. (While black
     bird-netting is less conspicuous, raccoons and other animals can
     easily get entangled in it.) A wooden or PVC pipe frame covered with
     wire mesh can also be built to cover the pond. Maneuvering over pond
     plants with any of the above can be difficult.

     An alternative frame can be constructed from heavy plastic lattice
     available from home improvement centers. Carefully cut the lattice
     so it fits in the pond; cut out pieces to accommodate any pond
     plants. Cover the lattice with bird netting (with the solid backing,
     animals are less likely to become entangled in the netting). The
     netting can be glued to the lattice using Shoe Goo® or other
     waterproof glue.

     For larger ponds, stake 2-foot wide strips of chicken wire flat
     around the inside of the pond edge where raccoons are entering. (Cut
     the wire as needed to match the curvature of the pond.) Raccoons
     will have difficulty reaching over the wire, and will tend to not
     stand on it because of its instability. To camouflage and extend the
     life of the wire, spray it with dark-colored automobile undercoat
     paint or other rustproof paint.

                                                         [74][raccoon8.jpg]
       Figure 8. Install two electrified wires, 6 and 12 inches above ground
     around field crops and other areas needing protection. The fence can be
     hooked up to a switch for discretionary use; when you want to work near
         it, turn the system off. Where the fence presents a safety problem,
        install signs, short pieces of white cloth, or other material on the
                             wire for visibility. (Drawing by Jenifer Rees.)

     Ponds with steep, 2-foot high side walls discourage raccoons from
     entering the water, but may be a safety hazard for small children
     and the elderly. These hazardous areas can be located away from
     paths and/or be heavily buffered with dense growths of tall marginal
     plants and shrubs.

     Two electrified wires, 6 and 12 inches above ground and just back
     from the water’s edge will deter raccoons. A single strand of wire
     may be sufficient, but two wires will provide added insurance
     against the animal making the climb. The wires can be hooked up to a
     switch for discretionary use; when you want to work near the wire,
     turn the system off. Where the barrier presents a safety problem,
     attach signs, short pieces of white cloth, or other material on the
     wire for visibility. (See "[75]Electric Fences" in Deer for
     additional information.)

     Prevent damage to lawns. Because worms and grubs inhabit areas just
     under well-watered sod, raccoons (and skunks) are attracted to these
     food sources. See "[76]Prevent Damage to Lawns" in Skunks for ways
     to prevent conflicts.

   Trapping Raccoons

     Trapping and relocating a raccoon several miles away seems an
     appealing method of resolving a conflict because it is perceived as
     giving the “problem animal” a second chance in a new home.
     Unfortunately, the reality of the situation is quite different.
     Raccoons typically try to return to their original territories,
     often getting hit by a car or killed by a predator in the process.
     If they remain in the new area, they may get into fights (oftentimes
     to the death) with resident raccoons for limited food, shelter, or
     nesting sites. Raccoons may also transmit diseases to rural
     populations that they have picked up from urban pets. Finally, if a
     place “in the wild” or an urban green space is perfect for raccoons,
     raccoons are probably already there. It isn’t fair to the animals
     already living there to release another competitor into their home
     range.

     Raccoons used to a particular food source, type of shelter, or human
     activity will seek out familiar situations and surroundings. People,
     organizations, or agencies that illegally move raccoons should be
     willing to assume liability for any damages or injuries caused by
     these animals. Precisely for these reasons, raccoons posing a threat
     to human and pet safety should not be relocated.

     In many cases, moving raccoons will not solve the original problem
     because other raccoons will replace them and cause similar
     conflicts. Hence, it is more effective to make the site less
     attractive to raccoons than it is to routinely trap them.

     Trapping also may not be legal in some urban areas; check with local
     authorities. Transporting animals without the proper permit is also
     unlawful in most cases (see "[77]Legal Status"). See [78]Trapping
     Wildlife for information on trapping raccoons.

   Lethal Control

     Lethal control is a last resort and can never be justified without
     first applying the above-described nonlethal control techniques.
     Lethal control is rarely a long-term solution since other raccoons
     are likely to move in if food, water, or shelter remains available.

     If all efforts to dissuade a problem raccoon fail, the animal may
     have to be trapped. See [79]Trapping Wildlife for information on
     trapping raccoons.

     While shooting can be effective in eliminating a single raccoon, it
     is generally limited to rural situations. Shooting is considered too
     hazardous in more populated areas, even if legal. (See "[80]Legal
     Status" for important information.)

   Public Health Concerns

     A disease that contributes significantly to raccoon mortality is
     canine distemper. Canine distemper is also a common disease fatal to
     domestic dogs, foxes, coyotes, mink, otters, weasels, and skunks. It
     is caused by a virus and is spread most often when animals come in
     contact with the bodily secretions of animals infected with the
     disease. Gloves, cages, and other objects that have come in contact
     with infected animals can also contain the virus. The best
     prevention against canine distemper is to have your dogs vaccinated
     and kept away from raccoons.

     Raccoons in Washington often have roundworms (like domestic dogs and
     cats do, but from a different worm). Raccoon roundworm does not
     usually cause a serious problem for raccoons. However, roundworm
     eggs shed in raccoon droppings can cause mild to serious illness in
     other animals and humans. Although rarely documented anywhere in the
     United States, raccoon roundworm can infect a person who
     accidentally ingests or inhales the parasite’s eggs.

     Prevention consists of never touching or inhaling raccoon droppings,
     using rubber gloves and a mask when cleaning areas (including traps)
     that have been occupied by raccoons, and keeping young children and
     pets away from areas where raccoons concentrate. (If washing raccoon
     droppings from a roof, watch where the liquid matter is going.)
     Routinely encourage or assist your children to wash their hands
     after playing outdoors. Unfortunately, raccoon roundworm eggs can
     remain alive in soil and other places for several months.

     If a person is bitten or scratched by a raccoon, immediately scrub
     the wound with soap and water. Flush the wound liberally with tap
     water. In other parts of the United States raccoons can carry
     rabies. Contact your physician and the local health department
     immediately. If your pet is bitten, follow the same cleansing
     procedure and contact your veterinarian.

   Legal Status

     Because legal status, trapping restrictions, and other information
     about raccoons change, contact your [81]WDFW Regional Office for
     updates.

     The raccoon is classified as both a furbearer and a game animal
     ([82]WAC 232-12-007). A hunting or trapping license is required to
     hunt or trap raccoons during an open season. A property owner or the
     owner’s immediate family, employee, or tenant may kill or trap a
     raccoon on that property if it is damaging crops or domestic animals
     ([83]RCW 77.36.030). In such cases, no permit is necessary for the
     use of live (cage) traps. However, a special trapping permit is
     required for the use of all traps other than live traps ([84]RCW
     77.15.192, [85]77.15.194; [86]WAC 232-12-142).

     It is unlawful to release wildlife anywhere within the state, other
     than on the property where it was legally trapped, without a permit
     to do so ([87]RCW 77.15.250; [88]WAC 232-12-271). Except for bona
     fide public or private zoological parks, persons and entities are
     prohibited from importing raccoons into Washington State without a
     permit to do so ([89]WAC 246-100-191).
