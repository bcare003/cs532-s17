   WWE superstar John Cena has racked up 12 reigns as World Heavyweight
   champ.

   [21]John Cena, the professional wrestler, rapper, and actor, is a
   record breaking champion with 12 reigns as WWE World Heavyweight
   Champion. As of 2015, he’s also broken a record of another kind and
   turned his wrestling motto “never give up” over to sick children
   battling for their lives. Cena has become the first celebrity to grant
   500 wishes to the [22]Make-A-Wish Foundation, and has said that he
   wants the children he visits to “have an experience that will stay with
   them to forever.”

   During an appearance on The Today Show in August, Cena granted his
   500th wish to eight-year-old Rocco Lanzer who was diagnosed with
   leukemia.

   In addition to his philanthropic involvement, Cena received praise for
   his performance in the 2015 [23]Judd Apatow film, Trainwreck, where he
   played a sensitive meathead opposite star and writer [24]Amy Schumer.

   [25]Larry King sat down with the pro last year to discuss his new
   fitness program and the newly launched WWE network. Here are a few
   things we learned from Larry’s interview with John Cena:

   1. Cena had his first kiss during a game of spin the bottle in the
   fifth grade.

   2. The best prank that has ever been played on him was when someone hid
   his WWE Championship belt when he needed it for a television
   appearance.

   crazy...and if you prank, the pranks come back at you." (Photo:

   3. His favorite hobby besides wrestling? Cena loves weightlifting, and
   also a decent bottle of wine.

   4. Cenaʼs favorite hip hop artist is [27]Jay Z.

   5. He claims the best trash talkers in the WWE are a toss up between
   [28]Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson, [29]Steve Austin, and Ric Flair.
