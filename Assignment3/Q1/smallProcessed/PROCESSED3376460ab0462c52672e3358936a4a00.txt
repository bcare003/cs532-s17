   Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Janet Hubert, Will Smith

   NBC

   Remember that time when The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air's Aunt Viv was all
   of a sudden…a different Aunt Viv? Janet Hubert played the matriarch for
   three seasons and then Daphne Maxwell Reid was there for the show's
   final three seasons.

   Life went on and the final episode of Fresh Prince aired almost 20
   years ago—but as Hubert proved yesterday, bad blood doesn't spoil.

   Seemingly coming out of nowhere, Hubert [31]posted a video response to
   [32]Jada Pinkett Smith's call to [33]boycott this year's Oscars over
   the lack of nominees for people of color. And not only wasn't it a show
   of support, the pointed slam drastically morphed into a major dig at
   Will Smith, whom she historically blames for her ouster from the hit
   show.

   Now this is a story all about how the feud got flipped, turned upside
   down (and every which way):

   Though it never cleaned up in the awards department, Fresh Prince was a
   huge NBC hit (and is enjoyed in repeats to this day) and was the
   vehicle that rocketed Will Smith to super-stardom. Less than two months
   after the series finale, Independence Day opened in theaters and the
   rest is history.

   But in the fall of 1993, season four premiered with a new Vivian Banks
   in the house—and while the lack of social media back in the day
   precluded the sort of conspiracy theories and immediate demand for an
   answer from the powers in charge of Fresh Prince, those things never
   happen for no reason.

   Of course it wasn't unheard of, the ol' turn-a-blind-eye re-cast dating
   as far back as the Darrin Stephens switcheroo on Bewitched and beyond.
   Roseanne, which replaced Beckys (and then switched them back!) even
   acknowledged the shakeup with a joke about Bewitched.

   However, the climate under which Hubert left was apparently not
   hospitable enough for a comeback.

   At the time, her exit was attributed to the age-old standby of creative
   differences. And that's certainly one way to put it.

   [36]NEED TO KNOW: When to bust out the 25 best dance moves from The
   Fresh Prince of Bel-Air

   Smith told an Atlanta radio station in 1993, mid-original-controversy,
   "I can say straight up that Janet Hubert wanted the show to be The Aunt
   Viv of Bel Air Show because I know she is going to dog me in the press.
   She has basically gone from a quarter of a million dollars a year to
   nothing. She's mad now but she's been mad all along. She said once,
   I've been in the business for 10 years and this snotty-nosed punk comes
   along and gets a show.' No matter what, to her I'm just the
   Antichrist."

   And he was correct in that Hubert wasn't just going to let it go.
   Presumably, however, he couldn't have predicted that anyone would still
   be talking about it more than 22 years later.

   In an interview with what later became Huffington Post's Black Voices
   section, Hubert said, "My departure was planned for a long time...
   There will never be a reunion of the Fresh Prince. Will Smith and
   Alfonso destroyed a 20-year-career with untruths. I got slammed. Will
   apologized later in an Essence Magazine article, but it still lingers.
   It's still there."

   Alfonso Ribeiro, who played preppy son Carlton Banks, said during a
   stand-up comedy set in 2009 [37]dug up by Perez Hilton (during which
   the future Dancing With the Stars winner also talked about his own
   almost-firing from Fresh Prince) that everyone he worked with was
   great, except…

   "First mom, not so much," he cracked. Cue the boos and hisses,
   interestingly.

   "You know, legally I'm not allowed to talk about it," Ribeiro
   continued. "But hey, why not? Basically, at the end of the day, the [he
   bleeped himself] was crazy. I did not curse…She went nuts! Long story
   short, and there were days when we were all on the set and she would
   literally go off on people and they got to a point by the time the
   second season came around where we're like, 'This is unacceptable.' We
   felt like, when we were doing The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, that we were
   a family…She, at that point, ruined that, and she made it very
   difficult for us to work, and unfortunately she was then fired. They
   brought in Daphne Maxwell-Reid, who we absolutely loved, and we moved
   on. Oh well."

   NBC

   Well that stand-up set took a turn for the serious.

   Addressing the members of the crowd who seemingly took offense in
   defense of the original Aunt Viv, Ribeiro acknowledged, "She was funny.
   She was a very talented actress." Going falsetto, he added, "Cuckoo!"

   In 2010, Hubert recalled to BlackAmerica Web, [38]per Huffington Post,
   "I was a dark-skinned, African-American mother, and Will used to tell
   the you're-so-black jokes to the audience before the show, and at one
   point, I came out and stopped him, and the audience went 'Woooo,'" she
   remembered. "He didn't understand how unbelievably disrespectful that
   was to women like me... 'Yo mama's so black, when she looks at her
   shoes, she thinks she's looking in the mirror. Ha, ha!'

   [39]WATCH: 10 times The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air got real

   The Will vs. Aunt Viv lore boiled up again in 2011, nearly 18 years
   after the fact, when Smith posted a Fresh Prince cast pic that did not
   include Hubert.

   She was soon after [40]asked by TMZ about the possibility of a Fresh
   Prince reunion, and she said, "There will never be a reunion…as I will
   never do anything with an a—hole like Will Smith. He is still an
   egomaniac and has not grown up. This constant reunion thing will never
   ever happen in my lifetime unless there is an apology, which he doesn't
   know the word."

   But an apology for what, exactly?

   If yesterday's video is any clue, it sounds as though Hubert continues
   to blames Smith to this day for not going to bat for her and the rest
   of his co-stars when it came time to negotiate a pay raise for the cast
   "like white shows do," like Friends. (The six principal Friends stars'
   unprecedented $1 million-an-episode pay hike didn't happen until 2002,
   eight years after Fresh Prince ended.)

   But in 2013, it sounded as though she was more amenable to the idea of
   a reunion (which, as we all know by now in 2016, never happened
   anyway).

   "It was a negotiation that should have come back like most do," Hubert
   [41]told The Grio in March 2013. "We were a very successful show and I
   felt like I was an integral part of that, and felt valuable, but you
   cannot feel valuable in Hollywood."

   Asked about rumors that she feuded with Smith and with Ribeiro, she
   said, "I think what happened, because the audience was so on my side at
   that time, that Will probably felt like he needed to go out, and he
   needed to tell a lot of lies. Alfonso went out to a college and told a
   lot of lies, but the problem is I have proof that a lot of that didn't
   happen."

   "I would say to him [Smith], we need to heal this," Hubert also said in
   the Grio interview. 'You've done some things, you've said some things,
   that were totally untrue and you know that they were untrue. I've said
   some things that I probably should have never said. But you've never
   heard them come from my mouth. Especially the TMZ thing last Christmas;
   my Mom passed away. So there I was again in the media getting beaten
   up…and you get tired. I'm tired. Aren't you tired Will?"

   The water-under-the-bridge tour continued in May 2013, when she
   [42]told omg! Insider that Smith did "some heinous, horrible things to
   me—they were like bad kids, Will and Alfonso—especially Alfonso. He
   said that I was crazy and nobody wanted to go to lunch with me."

   But Hubert also said at the time, "We need to have a reunion, we have
   to end this horrible, 21-year war. I think we all owe each other an
   apology."

   And in 2014, [44]on TV One's Life After, Hubert recalled moving to L.A.
   to do the show—"and the rest is mystery history."

   "When we first started Fresh Prince, it was such a joy...especially in
   the beginning," she said. She added, a moment later, "If you want me to
   kiss your ass, then you have to put it in my contract."

   Apparently no one ever let bygones be bygones—and no one jumped on the
   reunion bandwagon with her, though Fresh Prince was widely celebrated
   on the 25th anniversary of its premiere in 2015.

   Hubert's video message continued yesterday: "I seem to recall,
   twenty-maybe-six, -seven years go—25, whatever it was—I don't even
   remember. I seem to remember at option time coming to you and saying,
   'You know what, Will? You're the star of the show. Why don't we all get
   together and, with you, maybe we could get a little raise? Maybe the
   network since the show is, you know, such a hit and you being the star
   of the show, your influence would help us greatly, like they did on
   Friends. Like white shows do!' Remember that? Do you remember that,
   'cause I do. Mmm.

   "And your response to me was, 'My deal is my deal and y'all's deal is
   y'all's deal. Well karma must be a bitch because now here you are."

   Yes, Will Smith is in such a rough place right now.
   Concussion, Will Smith

   YouTube

   He got a Golden Globe nomination for Concussion, one of the movies
   cited as being overlooked by Oscar this year, he's one of the
   highest-paid actors in Hollywood and he and Jada just celebrated 18
   years of marriage on Dec. 31.

   Times are tough.

   But it's also his move if he wants to maybe, finally put a coda on this
   decades-spanning tale. He won't truly be able to be the faultless
   prince of a town called Bel-Air otherwise.
