[132]Rules

   Rule Description
   Our Mission Statement [133]Clear rules that help give the subreddit a
   balance of content. -- In addition please follow [134]redditquette and
   reddit's site-wide [135]rules.
   Spoiler Policy No spoilers in titles for 24 hours after a show has
   aired. -- If your post contains spoilers put the tag [SPOILERS] at the
   START of your title and the show title.
   Posts must be about wrestling "All link posts must be directly related
   to wrestling. Any link post not featuring wrestling itself, or in
   relation to a wrestling show or the wrestling industry, is subject to
   removal.
   No image posts that are: memes/image macros i.e. an image with text on
   it done for comedic effect or with slight variation for the sake of a
   cheap laugh (if it can be found on [136]/r/AdviceAnimals it doesn't
   belong here) or observations better suited to a text post.
   Don't reply as a new post If you want to fix someone's post, or have a
   better example of what's been posted, tell us so in the comments, not
   by making a new post!
   No spam or re-hosted content Always link to the original source and
   don't post re-hosted content. Only link to your own content if you
   contribute to the community.
   Reposts and vague titles Obvious reposts and titles that are overly
   ambiguous will be deleted at the moderators' discretion. (e.g. "This
   Guy")
   No Low-Effort Content Low-effort, single image link posts, including
   but not limited to, screenshots, crude photoshops, and MS paint-style
   artwork, are subject to removal. However, these may be posted as a self
   post with a description of the content.
   No "Plot"/Sexual Content Posts focused on sexual content will be
   removed. [137]/r/WrestleWithThePlot and [138]/r/WrestleWithThePackage
   are better places for this content.
   [Meta] posts Posts or submissions about the community itself are
   allowed as long as they follow the general rules of Squared Circle.
   Text posts A text post should have sufficient text in its body to
   either strengthen the title, create discussion or add more information.
   No Fake News [139]/r/SquaredCircle has a very strict policy towards
   troll rumors (fake injury reports, releases, etc.) and those
   responsible for posting them are subject to being banned.
   Moderator Discretion At any time the moderators will use discretion on
   any given rule. If they feel it's significant or unique to be up
   despite the rules. On the other hand, they also reserve the right to
   remove any post they feel breaks the rules. All of this can of course
   be appealed by messaging us.

   I'm not too fond of a lot of SNL, but I'll watch a lot of the YouTube
   uploads. Just got around to watching this episode in whole and it was
   realllllllly good.

   [226]Not Cena, but this was the highlight of the night.

   Yeah it's supposed to be comedy they really shouldn't be shoving their

   Agreed. It's been really good overall, with a few bad spots and more
   than a few amazing spots.

   Election years are always good for them though since there is so much
   more fodder for material.

   There was a study that showed that wrestling fans are actually pretty
   liberal compared to fans of other sports, but are also the least likely
   to vote.

   They were making fun of him like they have every Republican candidate
   in the last 40 years. But now that Trump started taking it personally,
   they are now doing it harder because now they know they'll get a
   reaction. People who haven't watched in years are now watching to see
   what's getting Trump so riled up.

     SNL can't really comment on Trump. They had him as a the host during
     his candidacy. You can't promote the guy and then bash him once he
     wins.

   Why not? They can say whatever they want. They have as much right to
   free speech as you, or me, or the paranoid lunatics that infest
   [570]/r/the_donald.

   Sure, I agree with that.

   But have you watched mainstream entertainment? It's not that WWE is
   doing something awesome, it's that what it's doing is not as pathetic
   as the negative cultural value the vast majority of entertainment
   brings.

   Even when I was a kid I'd heard older people talk about how bad TV was,
   and that it was filth. But I thought that was overdramatic stuff.

   But today, if you watch, it's a lot of drug use, homosexuality,
   promiscuous sex, materialism, alcohol use, greed, immorality in
   general. There's just nothing good in any of it, and it's never
   tastefully presented but just thrown in your face.

   At least when WWE handles homosexuality, and I am actually laughing as
   I write this, it has more class than what the mainstream media does
   these days. And if you know WWE history you know why I'm laughing at
   that. But it's true now.

   First of all, are you implying that homosexuality is bad?

   Secondly, I disagree with the idea that none of that should be
   portrayed on TV. I definitely agree that some of those things shouldn't
   be shown in a positive light, but portraying them at all doesn't make
   them trash.

   "Cultured" and "moral" are two very different things. A lot of culture
   is, for better or worse, rooted in sexuality as well as in vivid
   portrayals of bad behavior, if only to condemn it. Many of the most
   well regarded artists across all mediums were gay and laced their work
   with metaphors about their struggles. These kinds of things have always
   been present, even in entertainment that's considered "cultured".

   I actually thought Cena did okay. He had a couple sketches that I
   thought were really funny (dating game and the science project). There
   was some others where they were just bad ideas. The book store was
   baaaaddd, but Cena was okay in it. The Christmas tree one was just
   badly written and executed all the way around. Keenan Thompson seemed
   to keep forgetting he was supposed to be Charles Barkley. And Cena was
   bad in that sketch.

   While I've watched a little here and there, I haven't watched SNL
   regularly since around the end of the Ferrell Era. Maybe I set my
   expectations too low, but I was pleasantly surprised.

   Sure, the cold open was a cheap pop, but it was enjoyable. The dating
   show sketch was funny with a well-earned swerve at the end. This was my
   first time seeing Cecily Strong with the Cathy Ann gimmick and it was
   fantastic. SotN would go to the bookshop sketch. While we'll probably
   remember it for spots like "dirt man" and "ghost butt," let's not
   forget how on-point Keenan's psychology was. The owl bit is like a CZW
   light tube match: you'll enjoy it as much as you're into that sort of
   thing, but it's not going to change anybody's mind on it.

   If anything disappointed me, it was Cena. Whether it was the writers'
   fault or his, he spent too much time as the impossibly strong and
   muscly straight man. When he got the opportunity to be edgy (the finish
   to the monologue, The Karate Teenager, being Gronk, the Christmas tree
   sketch), he fell flat, relying on different accents and voices instead
   of actually working the mic. Sure, it's all heavily scripted (Lorne
   hates improvising dammit), but I think Cena let the rest of the cast
   carry the show while he milked his high spots. He never showed ass and
   refused to play heel, AKA: Cena at his worst.

   Cena was great. SNL is just flat out garbage. Bashing on Trump was
   funny at a time now it's just repetitive and beating a dead horse...

   SNL has no logical flow. Monty Python has one sketch flow to the next
   to the next creating not a story but more a line of thought for the
   viewer. SNL is just skit, skit, skit, weekend update, musical
   performance, skit show end with no rhyme or reason. Ironically Raw also
   has a flow.

   "Ironically Raw also has a flow"

   ...Really? Because that's probably my biggest problem with Raw. It
   feels really disjointed and thrown together.

   I'm not super high on Smackdown but it's a much better example of a
   loosely connected show that still has a flow.

   I catch SNL about 1-2 a month for the last few years, this was a really
   weak episode, pretty disappointed that two of my interests collided and
   it didn't result in something I really enjoyed. Cool that Cena got to
   do it though, people have been asking for years.

   1994-1995 had some all-time great sketches at least like the Japanese
   game show with Farley as the confused American, the debut of the
   Chanukah song, and Quentin Tarantino's Welcome Back Kotter, plus it was
   the first season with Norm doing Update. Outside of the Chappelle
   stuff, the most memorable thing from this season is fucking David
   Pumpkins.

   There were some good sketches, yeah, but there were also a lot of bad
   sketches - remember Chris Elliot as the dad date raping Mark McKinney
   as the braces-wearing babysitter? In addition, Phil Hartman left that
   year, after Lovitz, Carvey, Jan Hooks and probably a few more left in
   the previous seasons. While I loved Farley and liked Spade and Sandler,
   they weren't as good as in their first seasons and were primed to leave
   for film careers by then. Same with Mike Myers, who left mid-season,
   iirc.

   Norm was the best WU anchor ever, and the highlight of every episode
   while he was at the desk.

   The show nearly got cancelled that year, as well, and only got another
   season because of the huge cast and writer turnover - only five people
   stayed on for the next season.

   left. I miss the Digital Shorts. McKinnon, Strong, Beckett, and Mooney

   I do, in the sense that I love and respect the institute of SNL, but
   stopped watching in the early 2000s. Tonight and three weeks ago were
   the first two full episodes I've watched since then. The first five
   years were solid, 86-93 or so were pretty great, and 96-2003 were also
   good. Most of the other years were terrible, and I can't speak to the
   quality of anything non-Weekend Update after 2003 (Digital Shorts
   aside, those were pretty good).

   Edit: SNL is like Mad magazine; your favorite run will be when you
   first read/watched it, you can enjoy the older stuff, but eventually it
   goes downhill.

   Absolutely not. I first saw SNL in the Joe Piscopo/Eddie Murphy days
   before Lovitz and Hartman and Carvey filtered in. It definitely went up
   after I started watching SNL. Then it had a bad down period, and then
   reached another run of glory days in the 90s.

   I feel like what you wrote is a common crutch for SNL sucking. Like any
   criticism of SNL is just chalked up to people preferring the cast they
   started watching, and not valid. No, a lot of the time it's just
   shitty.

   You definitely have the first paragraph right, and I personally agree,
   but that's the common line - I prefer late 80s-early 90s personally,
   and I first saw it in 1997.

   As for the second, I agree it has more bad years overall than good and
   more weak episodes than strong per season, but the comparison to Mad is
   absolutely valid - the sentiment (theory?) has been made by many former
   writers and cast members, including in "Live From New York" which is
   where I remember seeing it first. I don't 100% agree with it, but it
   felt like a proper analogy to support the rest of my perspective(s,
   with Lionel Osbourne).

   I think the comparison to Mad is valid but in another way. It's a
   similar crutch that a lot of people use to excuse the quality of Mad
   going in the crapper.

   I think most people are capable of objectively evaluating
   entertainment. If it's good, it's good. They only do this kind of
   excuse-making with long running shows or bands or movie series with
   intermittent periods of being really bad.

   You can't watch 2 episodes & pass a judgement on how good the cast is
   just like you can't watch any 2 matches of a wrestling & know how truly
   good they are. See the Dave Chapelle & Ryan Gossling episodes for
   really good/great examples (won't set the bar too high for you, but
   these are universally applauded)

   My biggest complaint as a somewhat regular viewer is for whatever
   reason they've gone away from reoccurring fictional characters outside
   of Weekend Update. And they lean too heavily on the host.

   The Chappelle episode was the other episode I watched this season. I
   didn't make a judgement on the cast in this post, but in others I did
   mention I don't like the guys on Weekend Update now. That said, it was
   nice to see Studio 8H again, but I just don't have the interest in SNL
   that I did in my teen years when I saw every late 80s-mid 90s episode
   on Comedy Central and watched the then-current early 2000s live.

   Edit: first watched in 1997, switching between SNL and MadTV

   Your edit is spot on. I haven't enjoyed it as much as I loved it when I
   first started watching in 2008. But watching it tonight made me realize
   that I need more humor in my life.

   WWE could do their own episode of SNL with New Day, Cena, Enzo/Cass,
   Gallows/Anderson/Styles, and JeriKO, and it would be better than this.

   WWE comedy is normally building to a match which is the selling point.
   Sketch comedy is about making people laugh often in juvenile and often
   inappropriate ways for a moment. In that moment you should be
   entertained. SNL doesn't do this.
