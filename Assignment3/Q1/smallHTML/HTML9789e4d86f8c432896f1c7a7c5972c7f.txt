Doom can tap into external power sources as well. Thats normal for a sorcerer. Unless you are inherently mystical yourself (i.e part faerie like Morgan Le Fey) then you do not generate your own power internally but instead tap into the ambient mysetical energy of the universe and/or call on the power of mystical entities. <br />
<br />
According to Wanda an accomplished sorceress herself and who has experience wielding far greater energies than either Doom or Strange, Dooms magic is generally stronger. <br />
<br />
However with that said Strange was the Sorcerer Supreme for a reason and i believe part of the reason is down to greater mystical knowledge which allows for greater versatility and skill in wielding mystical energies. Doom may have more raw power but strange can defeat him through greater skill. Thats how it generally is with strange and his opponents.</div></div><hr><div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Black bolt z</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Top of their game?

I think people forget that although dr doom has people greater than him he is the single greatestbmind in th universe when he wants to be...<br />
<br />
He did trick the BEYONDER and take his powers over, which I think trumps all because that would be the height of his power.... And it be Dr. Doom BEYONDER powers VS strange...<br />
<br />
But even before the the BEYONDER move I think that dr. Dooms greatest power is his mind and I personally think not only is he stronger, but he is smarter...<br />
<br />
<br />
And dr strange only became sorc supreme. Because doom talked him into it... So I think if you can control your upon to thinking they are making their own choices and they are actually baring your biding without their knowing it your better!<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a bias opinion on the matter doom is one of my top three characters!<br />
<br />
....<br />
<br />
But per comics he is better by feats alone, he basically controlled all of existence for a short period, as well as before that I he was pretty impressive his super villain resume opens all kinda doors at interviews I bet!</div></div><hr><div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sundipped</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Originally posted by GalacticStorm <br />

Doc has more overall raw power (according to feats) as well as knowledge/experience in the mystic arts.  In Triumph/Torment Doc trained Doom before they went to Mephisto's realm.  Doom also tried Doc once with the Crimson Bands and Doc schooled him, reversing the spell telling Doom that they were not conjured properly.  If this thread doesn't involve Doom using power stealing prep, then he pales in comparison to Steve.</div></div><hr><div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>abhilegend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Classic Steve crushes doom sans prep.</div></div><hr><div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sundipped</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Oh yeah, and as far as Wanda goes, Doc put an unstable Wanda into a coma.

But at the end of that Strange wondered if Doom hadn't had the whole thing planned out. Doom had to much pride to ask Strange for help, so he might have intentionally got the bands wrong so that strange would turn them back on him, and in doing so protect him from the tests onslaught. and also forcing Strange to grant him a boon, which was Dooms intention all along.</div></div><hr><div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kingzeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Originally posted by Aakla <br />

I think Stranges strength lies in versatility and skill instead of raw power.   vice versa Strange himself has gone to doom stating he was probably the more skilled between the two overall barring Stranges benefit of being Sorcerer Supreme. Have to find where he said it.</div></div><hr><div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sundipped</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Originally posted by Aakla <br />

Not sure if that's the case.  I was thinking Doom turned on him because they were the only two sorcerers left at that point.  Regardless, Doc proved to be  superior for the simple fact Doom had to increase the power output on his armor multiple times just to keep up with the training.  It was also Docs shield that kept them from being incinerated vs. Mephisto.</div></div><hr><div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mindset</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Originally posted by Sundipped <br />
