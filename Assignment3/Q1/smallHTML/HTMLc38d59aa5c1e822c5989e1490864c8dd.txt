(1980-2000)</h2><div class="authorEditWrap"><span class="author">By: <a href="/user/profile/index/20614">SuperK1979</a></span></div><div class="divider"></div><div class="articleBody">Hello Everyone! Thanks for checking out my article. Since the age of three (1983), I have been addicted to professional wrestling (or "wrasslin"). In my opinion, 1980-2000, was a momentous two decades for wrestling.  One thing that I always loved about wrestling  were the final patented finishing moves that wrestlers used to defeat their opponents . Out of the hundreds of finishing moves performed, I have listed the 30 that glued me to the television. Additionally, this article will give full detail (thanks to Wikipedia.com)on how the finishers are performed and for an additional bonus, I have included YouTube clips to demonstrate these finishing maneuvers.  Also, I quickly highlight my favorite submission and tag-team finishing moves. <br/><br/>While writing this article, I was cognizant to three things 1) I left out some good finishing moves. 2) The majority of wrestlers are from WWF. 3)The list does not include women. In my defense, I was glued mainly to the WWF and didn't start watching ECW/WCW until 1995, women wrestlers were not as prominent in the WWF as they are today, and this is my top 30 which will differ from yours (For example, you may feel that The Rock's finishing move should be #1, which is cool and leaving the Frankensteiner off this list was hard for me). I hope that you enjoy my article/list as we go down wrestling memory lane.  Please leave a comment, I would love to check back and read what your favorite finishing move was or currently is.<br/><br/>"FAVORITE FINISHING SUBMISSION HOLDS"<br/><br/>5) Sharp Shooter/Scorpion Death Lock: Bret Hart/Sting/Owen Hart/The Rock.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/f3e_fb730d5902.jpg"><br/><br/>The hold begins with the opponent supine on the mat with the applying wrestler stepping between the opponent's legs with his/her left leg and wraps the opponent's legs at shin level around that leg. If the applyer decides to cross the opponent's legs around his right leg, he has to cross the opponent's right leg over their left, or, otherwise, he has to cross his opponent's left leg over their right. Holding the opponent's legs in place, the wrestler then grabs the opponent's leg which he has crossed over the other and steps over him, flipping him over into a prone position before leaning back to compress his lower back. While Bret Hart is the wrestler with whom the Sharpshooter is synonymous, it was actually Sting who first popularized the move in the United States while working for WCW. Called the Scorpion Deathlock, Sting used the move as his submission finisher throughout his career, particularly during the era when Hart was still a tag team wrestler (with the Hart Foundation) and not using the Sharpshooter in any of his matches. The one notable difference between both wrestlers' use of the move is that Sting would cross his opponent's legs over his own right leg, while Hart would use his left leg. <br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=EBCWBQQmho0<br/><br/><br/>4) Texas Cloverleaf: Dean Malenko.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/712_56ca899f1d.jpg"><br/><br/>Also popularly known as a Texas cloverleaf, the wrestler stands at the feet of his supine opponent, grabs the opponent's legs and lifts them up. The wrestler then bends one leg so that the shin is behind the knee of the straight leg and places the ankle of the straight leg in their armpit. With the same arm, they reach around the ankle and through the opening formed by the legs, and lock their hands together. The wrestler then steps over his opponent, turning the opponent over as in a sharpshooter and proceeds to squat and lean back. The hold compresses the legs, flexes the spine, and stretches the abdomen.<br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=c6HWhR1MN1s<br/><br/><br/>3) Figure Four: Greg "The Hammer" Valentine. "The Nature Boy: Ric Flair. <br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/072_68e3029766.jpg"><br/><br/>The attacker stands over the opponent who is lying on the mat face up and grasps a leg of the opponent. The wrestler then does a spinning toe hold and grasps the other leg, crossing them as he does so and falls to the mat, applying pressure to the opponent's crossed legs with his own. <br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=BiM1pQ3yNIo&amp;feature=related<br/><br/><br/>2) Camel Clutch: Iron Sheik. <br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/b84_130ef52d48.jpg"><br/><br/>The wrestler sits on the back of his opponent, who is face down on the mat, and places the arm or, more commonly, both arms of the opponent on his thighs. The wrestler then reaches around the opponent's head and applies a chinlock. The wrestler then leans back and pulls the opponent's head and torso. A camel clutch can also refer simply to a rear chinlock while seated on the back of an opponent, without placing the arms on the thighs.<br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=bBL89_n4lCc<br/><br/><br/>1) Crossface Chicken Wing: Bob Backlund (Heel)<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/3f9_07bba581a2.jpg"><br/>A chickenwing variation where the wrestler applies the chickenwing to one of the opponent's arms. The wrestler then uses his free arm to either push the arm, and particularly its radius bone, against the face of the opponent to cause pain, or wrap the arm around the neck of the opponent in a sleeper hold. The wrestler may also grasp his hands together in either variation. This hold is closely associated with Bob Backlund who popularized the move in America. (I note the irony that Iron Sheik and Bob Backlund are back to back on this list). <br/><br/><br/>"FAVORITE TAG TEAM FINISHING MOVES"<br/><br/>4) Dudley Death Drop (3D) D-Von and Bubba Ray Dudley "The Dudley Boys"<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/4f8_db4eea70d1.jpg"><br/><br/><br/>The Dudley Death Drop, often shortened to 3-D, is an elevated cutter which sees a combination of a Flapjack and a cutter. While invented by Dean Malenko it was named, popularized and became more closely associated with the Dudley Boyz. This maneuver sees an opponent get pushed upwards in a flapjack throw by Brother Devon then as the opponent falls to the mat Brother Ray would apply a cutter forcing the opponent's head down to the mat.<br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=GHT3Ms8qtpU<br/><br/><br/>3) Battling Ram Head Butt: Luke and Butch "The Bushwhackers"<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/321_0790335a67.jpg"><br/><br/>With this move, Luke would put his head under his tag team partner's armpit in a bent over method as though he was in a headlock. Butch would then run with his brothers head under his arm as if it were a battering ram into the opponent's stomach. <br/><br/><br/>2) Hart Attack: Jim "The Anvil" Neidhart and Bret Hart "The Hart Foundation" <br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/f5e_4027eb6138.jpg"><br/><br/>Technically known as a Bearhug, lariat combination, this was the traditional finishing move of The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart). Neidhart would lift up the opponent in a bearhug in the center of the ring, while Hart leaned against the ringside ropes, facing the opponent's back. Hart would then run past the two and bounce off the ropes on the opposite side of the ring. On his return, Hart would make a running leap and perform a lariat takedown on the opponent as Neidhart let go of him, resulting in both Hart and the opponent falling onto their backs. Hart sometimes did the lariat takedown from the second corner rope. Strangely, this move was never referred to by name on TV. In fact, when the Hart Foundation used it to win the WWF Tag Team Titles, commentator Jesse Ventura called it simply, "the Hart Clothesline". The name Hart Attack comes from a WWF trading card of that era.<br/><br/><br/>1) Total Elimination: Michael Kronus and Perry Saturn "The Eliminators" <br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/8e3_c3e4035af2.jpg"><br/><br/>As the opponent was standing. Michael Kronus would kick the man in the stomach while Perry Saturn would go from the back and sweep the opponent. It was a crazy move when I first saw it. <br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=l8IX6IWtwI4<br/><br/><br/>"MY FAVORITE 30 FINISHING MOVES"<br/><br/>30. Rock Bottom: The Rock.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/9ed_a026152cc9.jpg"><br/><br/>A wrestler stands face to face with the opponent, slightly to their side. The wrestler tucks his head under the opponent's near arm, reaches across the opponent's chest and around their neck with his near arm, and places his other arm against their back. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up and falls forward, either flat on their chest or their knees, slamming the opponent down to the mat back first. This move is very closely associated with The Rock who popularized the move as the Rock Bottom, although he would sometimes use a variation which sees him hook his opponent's leg in order to lift them easier. Booker T is also a practitioner of this move; his variation is called the Book End, although a noticeable difference is that Booker falls to his knees while The Rock falls chest-first and uses his hand to stop his face from impacting the mat (similar to the form of doing a one handed push up while slamming the opponent down to the mat).<br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=a-jAE5UYJY8<br/><br/><br/>29. Leg Drop: Hulk Hogan.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/ff1_d31a526794.jpg"><br/><br/>Variation to the original, the attacking wrestler bounces off from one side of the ring, runs and performs the leg drop across his/her opponent's chest. This became famous from Hulk Hogan, who used it as his finisher. Today, it's also known as the Atomic Leg Drop.<br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=MR21s5Ly4Sw<br/><br/><br/>28. Tomb Stone Powerdriver: Undertaker/Kane.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/080_7d3e03376a.jpg"><br/><br/>This variation of a belly-to-belly piledriver refers to any belly-to-belly piledriver that involves the wrestler holding the opponent in a belly-to-belly position, then falling to a kneeling position. The name "Tombstone Piledriver" was popularized by The Undertaker, and later Kane<br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=MCBCSelhCtM&amp;feature=related<br/><br/><br/>27. Bonsai Drop: Yokozuna.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/0c7_93b208bc33.jpg"><br/><br/>The Banzai Drop, sees a wrestler who is standing above a fallen opponent, go up onto the second turnbuckle (facing away from the ring) and jump down dropping his/her buttocks on the opponent's body (usually the chest or stomach). This move is basically a butt drop from a raised platform and was originated by Yokozuna.<br/><br/><br/>26. Superfly Splash: Superfly Jimmy Snuka.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/135_554d4637e6.jpg"><br/><br/>The splash was popularized in America by Jimmy "The Superfly" Snuka, one of the first 'high-fliers' to wrestle in North America, who called the move the Superfly. It was one of the first and most popular highflying moves to be seen in mainstream wrestling. Even today, the move is often called a Superfly Splash in his honor.<br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=CDCOS0lU-J0<br/><br/><br/>25. Fameasser: Bad Ass Billy Gunn.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/3a2_fd7a2c9c29.jpg"><br/><br/>A move best known as a Fameasser, due to its use by "Mr. Ass" Billy Gunn and also known as a Famouser when Gunn called himself "The One" Billy Gunn. The move involves an attacking wrestler placing the back of his/her opponent's head (who is leaning forward) under his/her leg before dropping their leg and the opponent's head down to the mat.<br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=icYB6SdX0Mw<br/><br/><br/>24. Perfect Plex: Mr. Perfect.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/e92_647ff4b33d.jpg"><br/><br/>Also spelled as a fisherman's suplex and also known as a leg hook suplex or a cradle suplex. Mr. Perfect is the most well known user of this move and dubbed it the Perfect-Plex, a name that has been adopted more generally since his death. With their opponent in a front facelock with the near arm draped over the attacker's shoulder, the wrestler hooks the opponent's near leg behind the opponent's knee with his/her free arm and falls backwards, flipping the opponent onto his/her back. The attacker usually keeps the leg hooked and bridges to pin the opponent in a cradle-like position, or applies a leglock submission hold.<br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=R8lb-2oGOP4<br/><br/><br/>23. Alabama Slam: Bob Holly. <br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/371_7dc29898ef.jpg"><br/><br/>Described as a double-leg slam, or flapjack spinebuster, this high-angle spinebuster variation involves a wrestler placing their head between an opponent's knees or under the opponent's arm, then standing up, holding onto their opponent's legs, so that the opponent is facing the wrestler's back. The wrestler then simply brings both hands down, throwing the opponent back-first to the mat. They may also hold the opponent in place while spinning in several circles before throwing the opponent down. The move has been known by the name Water-Wheel Slam and the Alabama Slam, named by Bob "Hardcore" Holly after his home state of Alabama<br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=eWhng9iRz2s<br/><br/><br/>22. Warrior Press Slam: The Ultimate Warrior.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/be4_e8c24eff00.jpg"><br/><br/>Warrior would use his upperbody strength to pick up his opponent over his head then drop him to the ground. <br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=J0AYmfvDsWk<br/><br/><br/>21. Clothesline from Hell: Bradshaw (JBL). <br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/28a_72a95533d8.jpg"><br/><br/>A Clothesline that hit so hard that it knocked the wind out of the opponent. <br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=lDY_c_r7vSw<br/><br/><br/>20. Somersault Kick: Starman. (Nintendo: Pro Wrestling).<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/919_05ce0ec4fb.jpg"><br/><br/><br/>As the opponent is standing Starman with a tap of down+A button Starman would do a backflip and kick the crap out of his opponent, I loved doing this to my friends especially after his starman splash (cheese move).<br/><br/><br/>19. Pedigree: Hunter Hearst Helmsley.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/ab1_5becd18a38.jpg"><br/><br/>The wrestler bends their opponent forward, placing the opponent's head between the wrestler's legs and then applies a double underhook on the opponent. The wrestler then jumps up while tucking their knees causing them to lift their opponent off the mat before landing on their knees, forcing the opponent's face into the mat. Triple H, the most famous user of this move, would name it the Pedigree during his "Greenwich Snob" gimmick and he still uses it today. The word Pedigree was commonly adopted when referring to this move.<br/><br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=_Et2unRI7bk&amp;feature=related<br/><br/><br/>18. Flying Elbow Drop: Randy "The Macho Man" Savage.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/e8f_8f4deeb91f.jpg"><br/><br/>A less common variation on a diving elbow drop; the wrestler stands on the top turnbuckle facing away from the opponent then leaps backwards, extending and cocking one elbow. This allows for greater range but less precision. Randy Savage would jump from the turnbuckles smashing his elbow into the throat of his opponent which had devastating effects. <br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=pFAYcD9qVAc<br/><br/><br/>17. Scorpion Death Drop: Sting.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/353_3ce97c7e11.jpg"><br/><br/>A reverse DDT. <br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=7PVSwoxXwuE<br/><br/><br/>16. PileDriver: "Mr. Wonderful" Paul Orndorff/Jerry "the King" Lawler.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/f46_64f720c4d4.jpg"><br/><br/>A piledriver is a professional wrestling driver move in which the wrestler grabs his opponent, turns him upside-down, and drops into a sitting or kneeling position, driving the opponent's head into the mat.<br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=724j5XgR7KE<br/><br/><br/>15. Jack Knife Power Bomb: Diesel (AKA. Kevin Nash).<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/19f_45ebd93b65.jpg"><br/><br/>The term Jackknife powerbomb can refer to a normal powerbomb which sees the wrestler keep his/her head between the opponent's legs and keep a hold on the legs with his/her arms before then flipping forward planting his/her feet and bridging back, completing a Jackknife pinning hold.<br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=vN65VWIHKBs<br/><br/><br/>14. Piranha Bite: The Amazon. (Nintendo: Pro Wrestling).<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/082_302feedebf.jpg"><br/><br/>The Amazon would grab his opponent and then proceed to use his razor sharp teeth to bite his opponents head.  It was such a cheap move and all your friends hated it when you did it to them when playing pro wrestling! <br/><br/><br/>13. Van Terminator: Rob Van Dam.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/a95_947ef4095b.jpg"><br/><br/>Van Dam would place an item (most likely a garbage can or chair) on his opponent's head on one corner of the ring. Van Dam would go to the other corner of the ring and climb to the top ropes and jump off and kick the chair or garbage can into the head of his opponent who was all the way on the other side of the ring. Basically, the Van Terminator is kicking a weapon into the opponent's body from the opposite turnbuckle that they are on. An example is Shane doing it to Vince at WM17.<br/><br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=0coZHJrlggI<br/><br/><br/>12. Ghetto Blaster: Bad News Brown.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/843_c2c9e00082.jpg"><br/><br/>Thus, an enzuigiri (often misspelled 'ensuigiri' or 'enzuiguri') is any attack that strikes the back of the head. It is usually associated with lighter weight class wrestlers, as well as wrestlers who have a martial arts background or gimmick. It is often a counter-move after a kick is blocked and the leg caught, or the initial kick is a feint to set up the real enzuigiri attack.<br/><br/>"Gentleman" Chris Adams' enzuigiri was often mistakenly called a superkick before bringing the real maneuver itself to the U.S. from his stint in Japan. In America, this maneuver was made famous by Bad News Brown, who used a running variation simply known as a running enzuigiri in which he calls it the Ghetto Blaster. <br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=_GUbUc_jqro<br/><br/><br/>11. Jack Hammer: Bill Goldberg.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/1f7_9cba846441.jpg"><br/><br/>One of the most devastating moves in wrestling during its time, Goldberg would grip the person in a suplex-like hold. He would then lift them in the air and hold them there for a couple of seconds. He sometimes would even walk around with them up there (depending on the size of the opponent), letting the blood flow to their head. Then he would bring them down into almost a powerslam maneuver, driving them through the canvas, and ending up on top of the foe for the pin. The Jackhammer rarely failed to put away a Goldberg opponent. It was used on everyone, including the 400-lb giant later known as the Big Show.<br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=JVgv5wqQgOk&amp;feature=related<br/><br/><br/>10 450 plash: 2 Cold Scorpio.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/788_9bda7c6fe2.jpg"><br/><br/>Invented by 2 Cold Scorpio, the 450 Splash, as it's correctly known, involves flipping forward 450 from a raised platform, landing on the opponent in the splash position.<br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=HRtTpGAejIQ&amp;feature=related<br/><br/><br/>9. Iron Claw: Giant Panther. (Nintendo: Pro Wrestling).<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/ace_ce9d84d48b.jpg"><br/><br/>The Iron Claw, sometimes simply referred to as "The Claw", requires the gripping of an opponent's skull and squeezing with the fingertips. Giant Panther just looked damn cool shoving his fist into his opponents face and holding it there.  <br/><br/><br/>8. Awesome Bomb: Mike Awesome.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/ee9_7b411a4dd7.jpg"><br/><br/><br/>A running one shoulder powerbomb, which Mike Awesome called the Running Awesome Bomb. When throwing the opponent through a table, Awesome would push the opponent off his shoulders by grabbing the opponent's armpits, similar to a crucifix powerbomb.<br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=72stT4-c4Bs<br/><br/><br/>7. Shake Rattle and Roll: The Honkey Tonk Man.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/9f2_51f64588eb.jpg"><br/><br/>The attacking wrestler applies a front facelock while he places their heads side by side under each other shoulder and uses their free hand to grab hold of the opponent's far hand before then swinging over the opponent and down to the ground, in a semi-circular motion, so that both the wrestler and the opponent fall to the ground back-first causing the back of the opponent's neck to impact on the shoulder of the attacking wrestler. The Honky Tonk Man popularized this move in the late 80s, calling it the Shake, Rattle, and Roll.<br/><br/><br/>6. Rude Awakening: Ravishing Rick Rude. <br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/74e_bcc3a047fe.jpg"><br/><br/>From a back-to-back position, the attacking wrestler reaches back and pulls the opponent's head over their shoulder, then drops to a sitting/kneeling position, causing the back of the opponent's neck to impact on the shoulder of the attacking wrestler.<br/><br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=J-RRzff_G3I<br/><br/><br/>5. Razors Edge: Razor Ramon.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/361_d6170feb4f.jpg"><br/><br/>The Crucifix powerbomb was made popular by Scott Hall, who calls it by the names Razor's Edge or Outsider's Edge, and sees an opponent lifted onto the back of the wrestler with their arms spread out as in a crucifixion. The attacking wrestler then drops to a kneeling position as they bend forwards to throws the opponent forward to the mat on to their back or neck and shoulders.<br/><br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=4gCjzwIcyHQ<br/><br/><br/>4. DDT: Jake "the Snake" Roberts.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/b5a_f1ab4591a7.jpg"><br/><br/>DDT is any move in which the wrestler falls down or backwards to drive a held opponent's head into the mat. The classic DDT is performed by putting the opponent in a front facelock and falling backwards so that the opponent is forced to dive forward onto his or her head.[1] The DDT is often prefaced with a kick to the stomach in order to drive the head of the opponent downwards; a kick and a DDT in quick succession is referred to as a Flowing DDT. The move was named by Jake "The Snake" Roberts, who accidentally invented the move in the 1980s. Rumors abound as to what the letters DDT supposedly stood for, including Drop Dead Twice, Demonic Death Trap, Death Drop Technique and Damien's Dinner Time after Jake's pet python Damien. When asked what DDT meant, Jake once famously replied "The End." The abbreviation itself originally came from the chemical dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane, a notorious pesticide, as stated during shoot interviews and on his "Pick Your Poison" DVD. Many think the term DDT was appropriated because the chemical DDT is something "bad" that is buried in the ground and causes extreme danger (and possible brain damage/birth defects) when there; similarly, a DDT is bad in that it buries an opponent's head into the mat, creating extreme danger to the brain and spinal cord.<br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=k43wRkQTx_Y<br/><br/><br/>3. The Diamond Cutter: Diamond Dallas Page.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/7f2_8974d1c2ab.jpg"><br/><br/>In professional wrestling, a cutter is a common term which refers to the three-quarter facelock bulldog maneuver. The move is also described as an inverted neckbreaker. This move sees an attacking wrestler first apply a three-quarter facelock (reaching back and grabbing the head of an opponent, thus pulling the opponent's jaw above the wrestler's shoulder) before falling backwards (sometimes after running forwards first) to force the opponent face-first to the mat below. Due to the facelock, the opponent's face often never reaches the mat. Instead, it lands on the shoulder of the attacking wrestler, thus damaging the neck.<br/><br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=UekMvH9DorM<br/><br/><br/>2. Stone Cold Stunner: Stone Cold Steve Austin.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/81d_53752469af.jpg"><br/><br/>It involves an attacking wrestler applying a three-quarter facelock (reaching back and grabbing the head of an opponent, thus pulling the opponent's jaw above the wrestler's shoulder) before falling to a seated position and forcing the opponent's jaw to drop down on the shoulder of the attacking wrestler. The free hand is sometimes used to hold the top of the head. The original move was used by Mikey Whipwreck, who called it the Whipper-snapper, in Extreme Championship Wrestling where he even jumped off a top turnbuckle to initiate the move. However, it was most popularly used by Stone Cold Steve Austin, who called it the Stone Cold Stunner, from where the term "stunner" is derived. Austin often preceded his stunner by giving an opponent the finger before kicking them in the gut and locking in the three-quarter facelock.<br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=dGaoKz6i_Ms<br/><br/><br/>1. Sweet Chin Music: "The Heart Break Kid" Shawn Michaels.<br/><img alt="article image" src="https://media.retrojunk.com/file/bc2b04389513f616719358af67b5c361fd0acc0f89209eeda368547dbda859ead662859c13204f/image/823_24ccdcc021.jpg"><br/><br/>Many wrestlers have used the superkick as a signature move since then, most notably Shawn Michaels who uses this as his finisher, referring to it as the Sweet Chin Music. Michaels often precedes the move with an inverted atomic drop, followed by a flying elbow from the top turnbuckle. While the opponent gathers himself and stands back up, Michaels usually stands in front of a turnbuckle and taps his feet, called by announcers as "tuning up the band", before landing the superkick. Michaels kicks the opponent in the chin, thus the move being called Sweet Chin Music. Michaels in an interview said that he learned the superkick from Adams himself while wrestling in Texas during the mid-1980s.<br/><br/>http://youtube.com/watch?v=JnYcLG_f9LM<br/><br/><br/>Lastly, just in case you were wondering. <br/><br/>My favorite wrestlers 1980-2000. <br/><br/><br/>1) The Ultimate Warrior<br/><br/>2) Kurt Angle<br/><br/>3) Sabu<br/><br/>4) Honky Tonk Man<br/><br/>5) Rob Van Dam<br/><br/>6) Dean Malenko<br/><br/>7) Ricky The Dragon Steamboat<br/><br/>8) Mike Awesome<br/><br/>9) Rey Mysterio Jr. <br/><br/>10) Taz<br/><br/><br/>But During the 80's I liked: <br/><br/><br/>1) The Ultimate Warrior<br/><br/>2) Hacksaw Jim Duggan<br/><br/>3) Honky Tonk Man<br/><br/>4) Hulk Hogan<br/><br/>5) Ravishing Rick Rude</div><div id="articleLoginPrompt"><span>Log in to comment on or rate this article.

            Wonderful wonderful article.  It brought back so many great WWF memories.  Thanks! Little known fact, I attended a WWF event in 1989 and sat 3rd row from the ring on the aisle where the wrestlers all came down from.  Got the Brooklyn Brawlers cigar (still have it somewhere) and a piece of streamer from Shawn Michaels (w/ the Rockers at the time) as they stormed down towards the ring.  The main event?

            Super K good list I must say. I was informed by your knowledge of finishing moves but LOD was the tag team in their time. What about AMW's Death Sentence? or Triple X's powerplex? Those are some good moves. What about Christopher Daniels Angels Wings or Low Ki's Ki Crusher those moves rule as finishers but all in all good list.

            Those are some great finishing moves Phenomenal1.  If I am still around and the year is 2010, I will have to reflect on the 2000-2010 decade and might have to make a top 50 with all the killer moves that exist now (F-5/Brock Lesnar/Canadian Destroyer and Samoa Joe's).  Legion of Doom! Damn they were a bad ass team...but I had one problem with them which made me biased against them....Demolition was my favorite tag team of all time until the Eliminators came out.  Demolition was WWF's answer to the Road Warriors, but me watching only WWF, I never got a taste of the Road Warriors until they came into the WWF and beat the crap out of my favorite team so I never really paid too much attention to their finishing move and forgot about it, but that is what I like about the feedback, I get to see what you all liked!  Cottonfluff thanks for the advise, I will definately have to give more of my own opinion to make a better article and I should have done that while I wrote this.

            There is a reason he didn't list The Canadian Destroyer, The list is the best finishing moves from 1980 to 2000, Petey Williams wasn't around back then. My main problems is the lack of The Road Warrior's "Doomsday Device" and Chris Benoit's "Crippler Crossface", I don't care if Benoit was a murderer the Crossface looked like it could kill......err...no pun intended I swear.

            this was cool to read, but i have to say some of the moves you chose are rather cheesey and bland by todays standard. and the Bushwackers over L.O.D. is awful...<br/><br/>i personally love a sick spinebuster (Arn Anderson, HHH) and the F-5 (Brock Lesner) and any moves the TNA X-divison pulls off weekly....

            I have to agree with phenominal1 here on one point. There was 1 move that should have been on your list.<br/>The Canadian Destroyer is by far the best finisher in the business bar none. No matter the decade. But with ROH and TNA making finishers seem more and more non-devestating, there is really not a point. Someday the finish of a match will be as simple as a drop toe hold because most wrestlers nowadays kick out of everything known to man.<br/><br/>One problem that I had with the article was the inventions of the moves. Some of them were way wrong. Maybe I shouldnt say invention, but the ones who popularized it and used it.<br/><br/>example; Fameasser<br/>I first saw this move used by a very young Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannety in the AWA almost 20 years ago. They called it the Rocker-Dropper. Shawn even suggested to Billy that he use it when he started in the WWE some 13-14 year ago.<br/><br/>2nd Problem. Though I have no problem with any of the tag teams listed, how could you possibly not include one of the greatest tag teams, if not the best damn tag-team in all of professional wrestling....The Legion of Doom/The Road Warriors, Hawk and Animal? I me, come on. You included the Bushwackers running headbutt, but not the Doomsday Device? How lame is that.<br/><br/>And you only seemed to include the ones who people know today without giving newbies the honor of knowing who first started using the moves. Like Shawn Sweet Chin Music. All it is is a savate kick, which was first used by "Gentleman" Chris Adams a LONG time ago. Shawn just put it in his move set and made is "famous".<br/><br/>Overall I like the article, but there were some flaws and a tad bit of disagreement.<br/><br/>I give it 1 1/2 thumbs up*/

            ChockerZ99, I remember that move! I was going to add it when Wrath was known as Adam Bomb in the WWF, it was a move called known as a Pump-Handle Slam but he called it the "melt down".   When he would slam them It looked like the person lost their breath.  Chris Kanyon's "flatliner" was awesome.  And I have always wanted to play Saturday Night Slam Master, I will have to download it when the wii has it in their virtual downloads thing.  Petey William's Canadian Destroyer would be #1 on my list if I did a 2000-2008 top 30 list but I kept it retro.  Sweet top 10 Hogan.  Sweet Chin Music is an awesome move it just stuns the shit out of opponents.  I also liked the "Stevie Kick" from Steven Richards.

            One that i think nobody ever saw but that looked extremely painful and badass was WCW Wrath's finishing move called "the meltdown".  talk about awesome.  he'd stand behind them and pull one of their arms between their legs, swing them up over his shoulder and then slam them down hard on the mat.  an awesome move.<br/>a couple others not to be overlooked - Chris Kanyon's "Flatliner", La Parka's spinning powerbomb, and since you're counting video games, how about The Scorpion's "Death Spiral" on Saturday Night Slammasters.<br/>Nice list though.  It makes me realize just how old Ric Flair really is.  That guy looked old in the early 90s.  It's 2008.  Someone stop him.  I think he faked a heart attack at least 3 times a year back in the 90s.

I sat down at work and had like tons of favorite finishing moves listed and after I wrote the article I forgot some great moves like the Giant/BigShow/Undertaker Choke Slam/Mick Foley's Mandible Claw Choke out/The FrankenSteiner from the Steiner Brothers/ and The FUll Nelson from WWF Hercules....but unfortunately I had to condense the article so that the readers could tell me what I forgot and tell me what their favorite moves are, because I love talking about wrestling and hearing what people love to see as their favorite finishing move!
