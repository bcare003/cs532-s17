In this episode of Elevating Beyond, Mark and Dayne sit down with globally renowned yogi and social activist, Seane Corn.

Caleb eventually landed in \nFort Erie, Ontario, where he decided to trade his NFL cleats for a mop\nand broom and started serving those around him. “ I know what it’s \nlike to hide from that fear. To live behind a mask of a performance \ndriven life hoping that you convince yourself and everyone around you \nthat you have what it takes.

    I love Mark's podcast. The stories being told are so inspiring. It is wonderful to see and hear about what people go through and how they've gotten where they are at now and yet never gave up, always aware of the bigger purpose they have. I highly recomment listening in.

    This podcast is a unique blend of authenticity, encouragement, and entertainment.  The two guys are funny as they pick on each other and move the show along with light hearted humor.  As they keep you engaged they pull out life stories from the guest in a way other hosts can't.  This is a real show worth catching.
