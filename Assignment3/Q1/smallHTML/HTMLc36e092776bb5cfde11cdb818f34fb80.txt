==SECTION 02: INTRODUCTION==
============================
Welcome to the Fire Pro Wrestling Returns General FAQ and Translation
Guide v1.8(u)! Fire Pro Wrestling Returns (Fire Pro R, FPR) is a 2-D
professional wrestling game made exclusively for the Sony PlayStation 2 by
Spike Co. Ltd. In FPR, you can choose from hundreds of wrestlers from
different promotions across the world, creating the possibility of endless
dream matches. Combine this with an extremely challenging and rewarding
gameplay system and a mega-deep Edit Mode, and you have what is quite
possibly the best wrestling simulation in existence.

The wrestlers in FPR are fictional in the sense that they are based on
very real professional wrestlers (mostly Japanese), but their names are
changed to avoid legal issues in the game's native country. Fortunately
the game has a rename option that allows players to give these likenesses
their real world names. This &quot;pseudo-realistic&quot; approach to wrestler
creation gives Spike the ability to up the roster to a mind-blowing total
of 327, nearly five times the amount of any American wrestling game!

But that's not all. With FPR, Spike has increased the available number of
wrestler edits (known as &quot;CAWs&quot; to most American gamers) to a whopping
500! Altogether, that's 827 wrestlers in a single game, each with their
own appearance, skills, movesets, offensive/defensive stats and CPU logic!

Indeed, with FPR, Spike has decided to pull out all the stops and give the
fans what they want; an expansive wrestling game experience with a nearly
limitless number of possibilities. Finally, long desired options such as
face/head layering, traditional steel cage matches and ring editing are
available in a Fire Pro game... and that's only the tip of the iceberg!

I need to mention here that this guide would never have been done (by
myself anyway) were it not for the Mysterious Kagura and Frank James Chan
(a.k.a. Icemaster), whose earlier Fire Pro guides are the basis for what
you're reading now. Frank's guides have introduced scores of players to
this influential wrestling game series, hopefully this guide will serve a
similar purpose. Thanks also to MDK for his transcription of button
mappings from FPD to FPZ, it made the task of authoring of this guide a
whole lot easier. Monitor also deserves a ton of credit for helping to
make this guide consistent with the North American release.

I would also like to make mention of the terrific community of players
spawned by their appreciation of Fire Pro Wrestling. Most of them are
extremely helpful and only too willing to help out newcomers, and were it
not for them, a guide such as the one you're reading certainly would not
exist. In that sense, this guide isn't authored by one person, but dozens
of people who are always looking for new players to share their Fire Pro
experiences, be it managing an e-fed, having a five-star match with a
friend, or simply LOLing at the mention of Pineapple Jojo.

===========================================================
==SECTION 03: THE HISTORY OF THE FIRE PROWRESTLING SERIES==
===========================================================
Before we delve into the guide proper, let's take a glance at what has
made the Fire Pro series such a sensation with gamers across the globe:

Since 1989, HUMAN Entertainment and Spike Co. Ltd. have produced the
unique and highly entertaining Fire ProWrestling series of videogames for
the Japanese market. In Japan, pro wrestling (or puroresu) is taken more
seriously both as a sport and a form of competition than it is in most
other regions of the world (with Mexico being the lone possible
exception). Pro wrestling even receives coverage in the sporting columns
of major Japanese newpapers.

Fire ProWrestling games are a reflection of this spirit, focusing on solid
simulation and technique as opposed to flashy graphics and mundane match
options. For this reason, Fire Pro has developed a loyal following in its
native homeland, as well as an ever-growing legion of fans in North
America, Europe and abroad.

Over the last fifteen years, over a dozen Fire ProWrestling titles have
appeared on several import consoles, including the PC Engine, Super
Famicom, Saturn, PlayStation, Wonderswan and GameBoy Advance. Two handheld
versions have even been distributed in the U.S. through BAM Entertainment.
And as you'll see here, even though the series has steadily built a solid
fan base, Fire Pro's own real-life version of Victory Road wasn't always
a smooth one...

Fire ProWrestling made its debut in 1989 on a Japanese console known as PC
Engine. The long standing tradition of using the likenesses of real-life
wrestlers began with this very first game, which featured timeless
classics as Victory Musashi (Antonio Inoki) and Star Bison (Stan Hansen).
And although the sparse roster of 16 wrestlers may seem anemic by current
standards, the game was an apparent success, or at least popular enough to
inspire two PC Engine sequels in Japan before moving over to the ultra
popular Super Famicom system.

The following excerpt is from The Mysterious Kagura's &quot;Pro-Wrestling
Video Game History:&quot;

   &quot;I believe the purpose of the Fire Pro series was to attract the
   'hardcore' pro wrestling fan. Given the idea that pro wrestlers
   from different promotions would be able to face each other in
   interpromotional 'dream matches' that normally would never even
   happen due to the political nature of professional wrestling.
   HUMAN greatly accomplished that purpose by using the likenesses
   of those wrestlers and giving them pseudonyms, but at the same
   time, gave them their real-life moves and attributes.&quot;

It was during this time that HUMAN boosted the popularity of Fire Pro by
providing gamers with several solid titles. And as import gaming became
increasingly popular during the early 90's (mainly due to the success of
Street Fighter II and other fighting games), it was not uncommon to find
Super Famicom versions of Fire ProWrestling floating around on import
gaming store shelves.

Even to this date, Fire Pro has arguably attained its biggest success on
Nintendo's 16-bit console. When it was all said and done, the Super
Famicom hosted no fewer than eight &quot;Super Fire Pro&quot; titles, including the
classic Super Fire ProWrestling X Premium, which remains a favorite of the
emulation community to this day.

Many Fire Pro fans outside of Japan were introduced to the series in 1996
with Fire Pro S: Six Men Scramble (6MS) for the Sega Saturn. As this game
featured at what was at the time an unrivaled amount of depth when it came
to wrestler creation (in many ways it still does), American gaming mags -
and even a few American wrestlers, such as Rob Van Dam - touted 6MS as a
brilliant alternative for fans of wrestling games who didn't mind having
to clear a language barrier to enjoy an excellent game.

The other remarkable feature of 6MS was its unparalleled roster. While the
rosters of previous Fire Pro games had steadily increased from the
original 16 over the years, the roster in 6MS topped out at 160, which was
absolutely unheard of back then. Even to this date, no wrestling game
outside of those developed by the creators of Fire Pro can offer such a
large collection of wrestlers gathered under one banner.

But a great roster is not enough to create a truly memorable wrestling
game, and fortunately HUMAN decided to complement the stellar roster in
6MS with the best gameplay in a Fire Pro game to date. With adjustments
and improvements in terms of animation and timing, the grappling system
took a vital step forward, and although it still wasn't the easiest system
to learn, many had decided it was definitely the best.

Helping to break the language barrier of import gaming was the exploding
internet gaming community, many of whom devoted selfless hours to making
sure that the uninitiated would be able to see what made these games so
special. Were it not for the efforts of classic Fire Pro personae such as
The Mysterious Kagura, and later the Icemaster (Frank Chan), many of us
would still be scratching our heads, wondering what the big deal is.

In June of 1999, nearly three years later the release of 6MS, HUMAN
released Fire ProWrestling G (FPG) for the Sony PlayStation in Japan.
Sony's system offered exposure to an even wider audience due to the
console's overwhelming lead in the console race, yet most longtime Fire
Pro fans were anything but impressed by the latest offering. In fact, the
concessions made to tailor the game for the PlayStation (4 Men Scramble?)
had many believing that Fire ProWrestling had seen its brightest days.

When HUMAN went out of business a short time after, Fire Pro fans were
even more convinced that 6MS would go down in history as the series'
greatest title. Yet like a phoenix rising from the ashes, Fire
ProWrestling would make a triumphant return to consoles in 2001 in the
form of Spike's Fire ProWrestling D (FPD) for the Sega Dreamcast. Touting
enhanced visuals, vastly expanded content and more match options than even
the most hardcore fan could possibly imagine, Spike did the impossible by
taking the Fire Pro series out of HUMAN's hands and to an entirely
different level.

The increase in both quality and quantity in Spike's Fire Pro D cannot be
understated. Simply put, they knocked one out of the ballpark with their
first swing. In fact, FPD was such an improvement over its predecessors in
nearly every aspect (sound being the lone possible exception) that it
basically rendered all earlier versions of the game obsolete, no easy feat
considering the nostalgia among Fire Pro fans when it came to the beloved
Six Men Scramble.

It was at this time that the series arguably gained it biggest fanbase
outside of Japan, as scores of disenchanted Dreamcast owners began looking
for new software for their beloved yet slumping system. Increasingly, the
name &quot;Fire Pro&quot; was being used as the benchmark for just how good a
wrestling game could be, and a result, more and more wrestling gamers
dissatisfied with the current crop of WWF/E titles began making the switch
over to this influential Japanese game.

Released for the PlayStation 2 in 2003, Fire ProWrestling Z was intended
to be Fire Pro's swan song, a final farewell for the diehard fans who
rigorously supported the series over the years. However, while the game
sported numerous improvements, it also seemed lacking in areas when
compared to FPD, especially in the audiovisual department. And when it
became apparent that the fans expected much more from the final Fire Pro
title (which is still a great game, if a little too similar to its
predecessor), Spike decided to go back to the drawing board and produce
another effort, one that would live up to the fans' lofty expectations.

Which brings us to the present, and Fire Pro Wrestling Returns. Has Spike
succeeded in giving the fans what they want? Well, judging from the
majority of reactions from longtime players, that answer is a resounding
&quot;yes&quot;. Consider this: how many video game franchises have managed to
escape extinction not once, but twice? Fire ProWrestling has, which is a
testament to both the enduring quality of the series, and the faithful
fans who support it.

Here's my list of recommended Fire Pro titles:

   * Super Fire ProWrestling X Premium (Super Famicom)
   * Super Fire ProWrestling: Queen's Special (Super Famicom)
   * Fire ProWrestling S: 6 Men Scramble (Saturn)
   * Fire ProWrestling G (PlayStation)
   * Fire ProWrestling D (Dreamcast)
   * Fire ProWrestling Z (PlayStation 2)
   * Fire ProWrestling (GameBoy Advance)
   * Fire ProWrestling 2 (GameBoy Advance)

D-Pad ..........Walk (the analog stick is not used for wrestler movement)

L Analog Stick..Performance (Taunt, Crowd Appeal)
                Every wrestler has up to four different Performances
                (taunts/poses/crowd appeals). Each one is triggered by one
                of the Analog Stick's four directions: Left, Right, Up,
                and Down. Some wrestlers may have the same taunt assigned
                to more than one direction.

L1 Button.......Breathe/Tag/Dodge/Ukemi
                * Hold Breathe to catch your breath and avoid fatigue
                during a match. Knowing when and where to use this is an
                important part of the match strategy.

                * In Tag Team Matches, press L1 + D-Pad toward a partner
                standing on the apron to tag out.

                * Press L1 (with the appropriate timing) to dodge an
                Irish whipped opponent.

                * Press L1 during a grapple or while lying prone on the
                ground for the &quot;Ukemi&quot; option (see the &quot;New Moves&quot; section
                of the guide for more details).

R1 Button.......&quot;3D&quot; Walk/Drag Opponent/Front Facelock (from grapple)
                Holding the R1 button while moving about the ring will
                modify movement so that the wrestler moves in a first
                person perspective rather than relative to the screen.
                (i.e. holding R1 and pressing Up will walk forward from
                your wrestler's point-of-view). This can be useful for
                tactics such as circling an opponent.

                Note that in tag matches, while holding R1, you will
                remain locked onto whichever opponent you are currently
                focused on. In other words, R1 can be used to bypass the
                Fire Pro auto-focus feature and focus on a single opponent.

                You can also drag a downed opponent around the ring by
                holding a direction + R1. And for the first time in a Fire
                Pro game, you can drag the opponent in directions other
                than left and right! Simply pressing R1 without a
                direction will make your wrestler automatically drag the
                opponent in the opposite direction he is facing.

Start...........Pause the game. From here you will see two options:

                   1. Continue
                   2. Quit (to Main Menu)

--GAMEPLAY CONVENTIONS--
------------------------

 ++ NOTE: If this is your first experience with the Fire ProWrestling
 ++ series, I would seriously suggest that you take a peek at the FPR
 ++ Beginner's Guide, a companion piece to this guide which was
 ++ specifically written to help newcomers get accustomed to the game.

The exact move your wrestler will execute depends on the wrestler's own
move set and fighting style. However, the method used in order to perform
those moves are universal. For example, the [] button always represents
the weakest attacks in your wrestler's arsenal, be it a scoop slam or a
single leg takedown.

As a general rule, you should gradually progress from your weakest moves
to your strongest moves over the course of the match. Attempting strong
moves at the opening of the match will usually result in a reversal or
counter, but depending on the circumstances, they may actually work. When
sticking to this basic &quot;weak-to-strong&quot; rule of thumb, you'll notice that
the flow of a typical Fire Pro match simulates that of a properly worked
professional wrestling match.

The command conventions listed here are broken down into nine individual
groups, with sub-groups within each group:

   * Striking
   * Grappling
   * Running Attacks
   * High-Flying Moves
   * Opponent Down Moves
   * Multi-Teaming (Double/Triple Team Attack)
   * MMA System (Shootfighting)
   * Performance (Taunt/Pose/Crowd Appeal)
   * Other (Various Conventions)

----------
-STRIKING-
----------
Striking moves are done by simply pressing any of the attack buttons. Over
time, players should become familiar with the distance at which you must
stand from the opponent in order to connect with striking moves. Also
note that different strikes must be initiated from different distances.

When standing (opponent also standing):

    []...............................Weak Strike
    X..............................Medium Strike
    O + D-Pad (any direction)...Strong Strike #1
    O...........................Strong Strike #2
    [] + X......................Strong Strike #3

-----------
-GRAPPLING-
-----------
If you're a fan of wrestling games, you'll already know that grappling is
the meat and potatoes of any respectable game, and no amount of bells and
whistles can save a game with a bad grappling system. Your success or
failure in a Fire Pro match will certainly depend on mastering the game's
excellent grappling system. And since it's not exactly friendly to
novices, it's important that you read this section closely to how to
understand how grappling works in a Fire Pro game.

To initiate a grapple, simply come within proximity of your opponent. When
you are close enough, you will see the startup animation for the grapple
automatically engage. This is your key to prepare for your command input.
At the moment when the two wrestlers make contact (arms locked), you will
hear a small &quot;smack&quot; sound effect. At this point, be the first to enter a
grapple command to win the grapple (which move is actually performed will
depend on which controller command was input by the successful player).

Don't forget that even when you DO win the grapple, the move can still be
countered/reversed depending on the circumstances!

 ++ NOTE: Repeatedly pressing a button rapidly (button mashing) will NOT
 ++ win a grapple, in fact it can cause you to lose it! For beginners
 ++ this may seem hard at first, but once you are familiar with it, the
 ++ timing becomes a completely natural reaction.

 ++ NOTE: Counters/reversals depend on many factors. In most cases, if an
 ++ opponent is not worn down enough to take a big move, the move may be
 ++ countered or reversed automatically. If the two players enter their
 ++ commands simultaneously, they will enter a Test of Strength, one of
 ++ the few instances where button mashing has any effect in this game.

There are four major grapple setups in Fire Pro Returns:

   * Front Grapple (grappling an opponent who is facing you)
   * Back Grapple (grappling an opponent who is facing away from you)
   * Corner Grapple (grappling an opponent who is in the corner)
   * Apron Grapple (grappling an opponent who is on the apron)

Listed below are the basic grappling conventions for Fire Pro Returns:

FRONT GRAPPLE
Grappling an opponent facing you. From this position there are 13 grapples
of varying strengths available to your wrestler, plus the ever-popular
Irish whip and Front Facelock options:

   []...................Weak Front Grapple Move #1
   [] + Up..............Weak Front Grapple Move #2
   [] + Left/Right......Weak Front Grapple Move #3
   [] + Down............Weak Front Grapple Move #4
   X..................Medium Front Grapple Move #1
   X + Up.............Medium Front Grapple Move #2
   X + Left/Right.....Medium Front Grapple Move #3
   X + Down...........Medium Front Grapple Move #4
   O..................Strong Front Grapple Move #1
   O + Up.............Strong Front Grapple Move #2
   O + Left/Right.....Strong Front Grapple Move #3
   O + Down...........Strong Front Grapple Move #4
   [] + X.............Strong Front Grapple Move #5

   /\...................................Irish Whip
   This is generally used to throw opponent toward the ropes. However,
   there are variations depending on your own position:

      * Your back is facing a corner:
      This will cause you to throw the opponent into the turnbuckle, which
      usually ends with them dazed in the corner. See &quot;Corner Grapple&quot; for
      more info on this position.

      * Your back is up against ropes:
      You will throw your opponent out of the ring. See &quot;High-Flying
      Moves&quot; for more info on this position.

      * Outside the ring with your back up against the apron:
      You will throw your opponent back into the ring.

   R1 Button.........................Front Facelock
   Used to grab the opponent by the head and move him/her around the ring,
   which is useful when moving the opponent to the center of the ring or
   away from his or her partner's corner. There is a variation to this:

      * Your back is up against ropes:
      This will cause you to throw the opponent out to the apron (but not
      down to the floor). From here you can set up an Apron Grapple move
      (see &quot;Apron Grapple&quot; for more info).

   Also, in tag matches, you can tag out while holding an opponent in the
   Front Facelock, which can be useful for setting up double team
   maneuvers.

BACK GRAPPLE
Grappling an opponent from behind. This is usually only possible if the
opponent is standing dazed, is busy fighting others in a multiplayer
situation (i.e. Battle Royal), or has the &quot;Back Switch&quot; move in their
front grapple set.

  [].......................Weak Back Grapple Move
  X......................Medium Back Grapple Move
  O...................Strong Back Grapple Move #1
  O + Up/Down.........Strong Back Grapple Move #2
  O + Left/Right......Strong Back Grapple Move #3
  [] + X..............Strong Back Grapple Move #4

  /\...................................Irish Whip
  See &quot;Front Grapple /\&quot; above.

  R1 Button...................Double Team Setup #1
  Used to hold the opponent's arms back, allowing a partner to attack
  (strike only).

  R1 Button + Up..............Double Team Setup #2
  Used to hoist opponent on your shoulders to set up double team moves,
  such as the Road Warriors' Doomsday Device.

When an opponent grapples you from behind, you can attempt to counter by
pressing [] or X. The timing for countering is the same as grappling
offensively, as described at the top of this section.

CORNER GRAPPLE
When an opponent is dazed in the corner (see &quot;Front Grapple /\&quot; for
whipping to corner) you can walk in and grapple them. Note that only the
east and west ringposts may be used for corner setups. You may climb the
north and south ringposts for high-flying moves, but you cannot whip your
opponent into them.

   O + Up...................Corner Grapple Move #1
   O + Left/Right...........Corner Grapple Move #2
   O + Down.................Corner Grapple Move #3

   R1 Button...........................Tree of Woe
   Sets the opponent up in the &quot;Tree of Woe&quot; (hooked upside-down on the
   ringpost). You can strike the opponent from this position.

Note that certain moves that &quot;throw&quot; opponents from the top turnbuckle
(i.e. Superplex) require a SECOND grapple input, which is to be performed
as your wrestler is grappling the opponent on the top rope.

APRON GRAPPLE
When an opponent is standing on the apron, walk into them to grapple just
as you would for normal front grapple moves. (See R1 Button under the
&quot;Front Grapple&quot; section above for an easy way to get opponents out to the
apron in order to set up these moves.)

   []/X/O................Inside Apron Grapple Move

When an opponent tries to perform an apron grapple, you can attempt to
counter the move:

   []/X/O...............Outside Apron Grapple Move

-----------------
-RUNNING ATTACKS-
-----------------
Make your wrestler start running by pressing /\. Make your wrestler stop
running by pressing the D-Pad in the opposite direction he/she is running.

*Running Moves*
While running toward the opponent:

   [].............................Running Attack #1
   X..............................Running Attack #2
   O..............................Running Attack #3

*Run Counters*
When an opponent is running (either voluntarily or after being Irish
whipped), you have three run counter moves to defend yourself with. Keep
in mind that your wrestler is vulnerable to run counters when you run
voluntarily.

   []................................Run Counter #1
   X.................................Run Counter #2
   O.................................Run Counter #3

   L1 Button..................................Dodge
   Used to dodge a running opponent. Depending on your fighting style,
   this may be a leap frog or drop to the mat.

*Corner Run*
When an opponent is dazed in the corner (see &quot;Front Grapple /\&quot; on
throwing to corner) you can run toward them for a move.

   O...............................Corner Run Attack

-------------------
-HIGH-FLYING MOVES-
-------------------
High-flying moves are death-defying aerial maneuvers that can really wow
the audience. These moves are not necessarily available to all wrestlers;
in fact some cannot climb the turnbuckle at all! Generally speaking, large
heavyweights generally use very few high-flying moves, while luchadors and
juniors use quite a few.

For top rope attacks such as Missile Kicks, you can attempt them whether
the opponent is dazed or not, although it would generally be wise to
attempt such moves only when they are dazed as the opponent has to be
pretty much stationary for the move to connect.

*Running Dive to Opponent Outside*
When in the ring and an opponent is standing outside, run toward the ropes
in the direction opposite the opponent, then hold the O button as you hit
the opposite ropes. Continue holding O as your wrestler heads back toward
the opponent and he will catapult himself outside the ring (provided he
has such a move in his moveset).

*Slingshot to Opponent Outside*
When in the ring and an opponent is standing outside, stand up against the
ropes closest to the opponent and press O + D-Pad in the direction toward
the opponent to launch your wrestler over the top rope (provided he has
such a move in his moveset).

*Slingshot from Apron to Opponent Inside*
When standing on the apron and an opponent is in the ring, press O + D-Pad
in the direction toward the opponent to propel your wrestler back into the
ring with a flying attack (provided he has such a move in his moveset).

*Top Turnbuckle Moves*
Climb the post by standing near it and pressing [] or X + D-Pad in the
direction toward it. Note that, unlike Irish whipping to the corner, high
flying moves that involve climbing the post (i.e. moonsaults) can be
performed from any of the four turnbuckles. You can also climb corners
from the outside by pressing [] + D-Pad in the direction toward the corner
when standing near it on the apron.

Also, when standing on the apron, you can swing around a corner post to
move to the apron on another side of the ring by pressing X + D-Pad in the
direction toward the corner.

   []...................................Post Move #1
   X....................................Post Move #2
   O....................................Post Move #3
   [] + X...............................Post Move #4

Which moves are aimed at standing opponents and which are aimed at downed
opponents depends on each wrestler's moveset.

*Run-Up Rebound Moves*
Run toward a corner and hold [] or X to perform an acrobatic move off the
ringpost. Very few wrestlers have these types of moves in their
repertoire, but they are exciting to watch. As &quot;off the middle of the
rope&quot; type moves such as Chris Jericho's Lionsault aren't available in
FPR, these attacks are about the next best thing.

   [].......................Run-Up Rebound Attack (Standing Opponent)
   X........................Run-Up Rebound Attack (Downed Opponent)

-----------------------
-OPPONENT DOWNED MOVES-
-----------------------
When an opponent is down, you can perform grounded strikes and submissions
by standing over them and inputting the proper command. For pro wrestlers,
at least one of these moves should result in a pin attempt. Shootfighters
(mixed martial artists) should not have a pin at all.

*At Head, Opponent Facing Up*

   X...........................Opponent Down Move #1
   O...........................Opponent Down Move #2

   [].........Lift opponent to feet by the hair/head
   If the opponent is sufficiently worn, this is a great way to set them
   up standing dazed in order to perform strong strikes, back grapples,
   and high-flying moves from the top rope.

   R1 Button...........................Drag Opponent
   Use the R1 button + D-Pad to drag a downed opponent around the ring.
   Often used to pull opponents away from the ropes to avoid a rope break
   if Rope Check is On (see Match Configuration).

*At Feet, Opponent Facing Up*

   X...........................Opponent Down Move #3
   O...........................Opponent Down Move #4
   [].......Roll Opponent Over to Face Down Position
   R1 Button...........................Drag Opponent

*At Head, Opponent Facing Down*

   X...........................Opponent Down Move #5
   O...........................Opponent Down Move #6
   [].........Roll Opponent Over to Face Up Position
   R1 Button...........................Drag Opponent

*At Feet, Opponent Facing Down*

   X...........................Opponent Down Move #7
   O...........................Opponent Down Move #8

   []............Lift opponent to feet by the tights
   If the opponent is worn down enough, this is a great way to set them
   up standing dazed in order to perform strong strikes, back grapples,
   or high-flying moves from the top rope.

   R1 Button...........................Drag Opponent

*Running at a Downed Opponent*
Run toward a downed opponent and hold O to execute a running strike.

---------------
-MULTI-TEAMING-
---------------
Double and triple team moves occur when more than one wrestler grapples an
opponent. Such a situation may occur in Battle Royals or even tag matches
when wrestlers are in the ring helping their partner. Situations for
multi-teaming include:

   Front Double Team (2 grapple an opponent from the front)
   Front Triple Team (3 grapple an opponent from the front)
   Back Double Team (2 grapple an opponent from behind)
   Back Triple Team (3 grapple an opponent from behind)
   Corner Double Team (2 corner grapple an opponent)
   Corner Triple Team (3 corner grapple an opponent)

----------------------------
-MMA SYSTEM (SHOOTFIGHTING)-
----------------------------
Shootfighting (mixed martial arts, MMA) became a huge phenomenon in Japan
several years ago, when MMA events would regularly outdraw pro wrestling
events. Currently, more and more people in North America are discovering
this fantastic and exciting new sport. In Fire Pro Returns, shoot-style
takedowns are available to all mixed martial artists as well as several
shoot-style workers. The method varies between fighters, although it is
usually assigned as one of the grapples, strikes and/or one of the
downed moves.

Note that ALL characters - be they shootfighters or pro wrestlers - have
moves available to them from the various shoot positions, so that they may
defend themselves from these positions if necessary.

*Guard Position*
The timing for the mount grapple is just after the attacker leans his
torso back and is leaning forward to initiate his attack.

   [].........................Guard Position Move #1
   X..........................Guard Position Move #2
   O..........................Guard Position Move #3

If you are on the receiving end of a mount, you can counter by pressing
any of the three buttons ([]/X/ O) at the signal. This will execute your
Mount Position Counter Move.

*Mount (Facelock/Sprawl) Position*
When you counter a shooter's attempt to tackle you for a mount, you will
have him in a front facelock. In MMA, this counter position is commonly
known as a &quot;sprawl&quot;. The timing for the mount/facelock grapple is when the
fighter that is countering slams his opponent to the mat.

   [].......................Mount (Facelock) Move #1
   X........................Mount (Facelock) Move #2
   O........................Mount (Facelock) Move #3

If you are on the receiving end of a front facelock, you can counter by
pressing any of the three buttons ([]/X/O) at the signal. This will
execute your Mount/Facelock Counter Move.

*Back Mount Position*
In the back mount position, wait for the mounting fighter to raise both
fists, that is the ready position which is your signal to press a button.

   []....................Back Mount Position Move #1
   X.....................Back Mount Position Move #2
   O.....................Back Mount Position Move #3

If you are on the receiving end of a Back Mount, you can counter by
pressing any of the three buttons ([]/X/O) at the signal. This will
execute your Back Mount Counter Move.

 ++ NOTE: MMA is definitely one of the tougher aspects to master in FPR.
 ++ Therefore it is recommended that you learn the basics of Fire Pro's
 ++ main grappling system before moving on to shootfighting. If you feel
 ++ you are ready for the shootfighting challenge, please refer to my
 ++ Quinton &quot;Rampage&quot; Jackson Fire Pro Returns character guide, which
 ++ describes the game's MMA system in much greater detail.

---------------------------------------
-PERFORMANCE (TAUNT/POSE/CROWD APPEAL)-
---------------------------------------
Performing can be useful depending on your wrestler's fighting style.
Every wrestler has four available performances, which are performed by
pressing any of the four directions on the Analog Stick:

   Analog Stick Left..................Performance #1
   Analog Stick Right.................Performance #2
   Analog Stick Up....................Performance #3
   Analog Stick Down..................Performance #4

----------------------------------------
-OTHER TECHNIQUES (VARIOUS CONVENTIONS)-
----------------------------------------

EXITING AND ENTERING THE RING
To exit the ring, to go out to the floor or entrance ramp, simply stand up
against the ropes and press [] + D-Pad in the direction toward the ropes.
Do the same up against the ring apron to go back inside. Rather than
exiting directly down to the floor, you can also exit out to the apron
first by using X instead of []. Doing so again will jump down to the
floor. Similarly, you can use X to climb up to the apron before going
directly inside. You can also press [] + X to slide into the ring.

USING WEAPONS
To acquire a weapon, go outside to the floor, stand up against the ring
apron, and press /\ + D-Pad toward the ring to grab a weapon from
underneath the ring. You can even choose your custom wrestler's weapon
preference if so desired.

Weapons can be dropped voluntarily by pressing /\ again. They are also
dropped automatically when grappling, when an opponent lands a successful
strike, or when coming into contact with just about anything (running into
a ringpost, colliding with a running opponent, etc.).

Note that some functions (such as grappling) are disabled while wielding a
weapon. You CAN use Breathe when holding a weapon without dropping it.

To pick up a dropped weapon, press /\ + Down when standing just slightly
&quot;above&quot; the upper rim of it. Since the button input is shared with the
&quot;Run&quot; command, this takes some practice, but becomes natural over time.

Warning: If DQ count is On, watch for the ref count when bringing a weapon
into the ring. You can attack with it as much as you like, but if you do
not drop the weapon by the count of five, you're disqualified!

STAYING DOWN ON THE MAT
If you would like to stay down on the mat (for instance, to convince a
human opponent you're injured), hold the X button while you are down. If
you are in the process of getting up to your feet, holding [] will keep
you in a crouched position for a limited amount of time, which is useful
for dodging strikes when an opponent is expecting you to get up.

When holding X while lying on the mat, you can also hold the D-Pad Up or
Down, and if the wrestler has recovered enough, he will roll in a north or
south direction. You can use this to roll out to the floor or to dodge a
top rope move, since the recovery time for rolling is slightly quicker
than that of standing up. Just hold X + Up and you will roll to safety
while your opponent hits the floor in an unpleasant way!

VOLUNTARILY RELEASING A PIN/SUBMISSION/ILLEGAL HOLD
If you would like to release a pin or hold to continue punishing your
opponent, or are performing an illegal act on an opponent and would like
to avoid disqualification (if the DQ Count is on), press the X button.
Your wrestler will cease whatever activity he's engaged in and allow the
opponent to regain their footing.

KICKING OUT OF PINS AND ESCAPING HOLDS
To kick out of a pin attempt, tap the X button rapidly. You can simply
hold the X button down with mashing, but it may reduce your chances of
kicking out of the pin, and repeated presses help to recuperate spirit
energy. To escape a submission hold, simply roll the D-Pad around rapidly.

-----------------------------------------
-NEW MOVES EXCLUSIVE TO FIRE PRO RETURNS-
-----------------------------------------

CORNER-TO-CENTER ATTACK
The Corner-to-Center Attack is performed by going to the east or west
turnbuckle and pressing O + Away when your opponent is downed near the
center of the ring. If your wrestler doesn't have a Corner-to-Center
Attack in his or her arsenal, this does nothing.

   O + Away (in corner, opp. down)........Corner-to-Center Attack

STEEL CAGE COMMANDS
With the all-new steel cage comes all-new playing conventions. You can
scale the cage to escape, and even pull off high-flying moves from the top
(provided your wrestler has such an attack in his or her arsenal).

   []/X (on ground)....................................Ascend cage
   D-Pad......................................Move (while on cage)
   O (on ground, opp. climbing).........................Shake cage
   O (while climbing, opp. climbing)...............Attack opponent
   []/X (near turnbuckle).............................Climb corner
   O (climb corner, top of cage)..........Dive off the top of cage

   From Grapple:
   /\ + Away (back to ropes).........Ram opponent's head into cage

OVER THE TOP ROPE TOSS
You can now toss an opponent over the top rope. You can perform this move
from anywhere inside the ring; if the wrestlers aren't close to the ropes,
the wrestler performing the toss will drag his opponent by the hair to the
ring edge, then do the toss. If the opponent is not sufficiently worn
down, he will simply roll under the bottom rope and back into the ring.

   From Grapple:
   R1 + /\............................Toss opponent over top rope

REENTERING THE RING (SLIDE)
In previous Fire Pro games, you could reenter the ring one of two ways;
by climbing up on the apron then walking through the ropes, or by rolling
under the ropes into the ring. Now you can also perform a stylish slide
into the ring!

   [] + X + D-Pad toward ring......................Slide into ring
      (outside of ring, near apron)

UKEMI
In real-life terms, &quot;ukemi&quot; means defending against an attack. In Fire Pro
terms, pressing L1 at the right moment disables your wrestler's ability to
use ukemi; in other words, it basically renders him or her defenseless.

Holding L1 during a grapple or while lying prone on the ground disables
all auto-counter/reversal functions, meaning that the opponent can attempt
whichever move they want without fear of retaliation.

   L1 (while grappling or downed)............................Ukemi

--MATCH MAKER-- *!!!UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!*
---------------
Match Maker puts you in the role of a pro wrestling booker, allowing you
to create a complete match card (or series of cards), from opener to
headliner. You are then awarded points for your performance, which are
determined by the how well the audience reacts to the show.

When entering Match Maker, you are presented with three options:

   1. Season Play - Manage a complete year's worth of wrestling events.
   2. Competition Play - Manage a single wrestling event.
   3. Ranking - Shows the highest rankings in Season and Competition.

SEASON PLAY
*!!!UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!*

COMPETITION PLAY
After choosing Competition Play, you will first be prompted to name your
wrestling card. You are then prompted to choose a promotion you would like
to book an event for. After selecting your promotion, you are able to book
the card itself, from opening match to headliner (7 matches total). If
you're familiar with real-life events/feuds this promotion has used in the
past (such as the Kuishinbo Kamen vs. Ebessan feud in the Osaka Pro
promotion), you may want to recreate some of these scenarios here.

That's it for the various match setups. Now let's take a look at the
individual match types and options:

--S-1 RULES MATCH--

S-1 (or K-1, as it's known in the real world) rules means NO grappling,
only striking. You may initiate a grapple, but unless the grapple leads to
a striking attack, the contestants will merely clinch one another. As you
might expect, matches can end very quickly with these rules!

=========================
==SECTION 07: EDIT MODE==
=========================
The heart and soul of the Fire Pro series. this mode allows players to
keep the game up-to-date in many areas of pro wrestling, providing
infinite replay value.

And in case you're curious, yes, Fire Pro is where it all started when it
comes to wrestler creation. And after observing the options below, I think
you'll agree it still can't be beat.

From the main menu, select &quot;Edit&quot; to see the following options:

   +------------------------------+
   |          EDIT MENU           | 
   |------------------------------|
   | 1. Wrestler                  |
   | 2. Referee                   |
   | 3. Edit Ring                 |
   | 4. Edit Logo                 |
   | 5. Edit Belt                 |
   | 6. Edit Team (for 5 vs. 5)   |
   +------------------------------+

At the bottom of the Edit screen, you will see a list of numbers running
horizontally across the screen. These are:

[# of promotions currently used / # of promotion slots left]
        [# of factions currently used / # of faction slots left]
                [# of wrestlers currently used / # of wrestler slots left]

-----------------
--WRESTLER EDIT--
-----------------
In Wrestler Edit, you have a variety of options. Not only can you create
your own custom wrestler, but create new organizations and groups within
the game. You can also send wrestlers to different organizations, reorder
them within the roster, and even retire them if necessary.

ORGANIZATION EDIT
When you first enter Wrestler Edit, you'll see an option at the top of the
screen (return to top), followed by a list of organizations (the first one
will say VIEW JAPAN (a.k.a. New Japan). The last entry is &quot;Retired&quot;, this
is where you will put the in-game wrestlers that you no longer want to show
up in the match menus (ex. an in-game wrestler that you've made an updated
version of).

Highlight any promotion and press [] to bring up the following options:

   1. Top (return to top of menu)
   2. Open/close all (see note below)
   3. Create new:
         Organization
         Group
   4. Switch (reorder organization; i.e. put NOAH before AJPW)
   5. Edit Name
   6. Change Logo
   7. Delete

 ++ A NOTE ABOUT FOLDERS: The folder system is new to Fire Pro menu
 ++ navigation. It works very much like a Windows or Mac window; simply
 ++ highlight any folder with a red triangle beside it and press O to
 ++ spill open its contents, or press X to select folder content.

GROUP EDIT
Groups (a.k.a. stables, factions) exist within organizations, allowing a
group of wrestlers to create a team, much as they do in real-life.

After you have entered Edit Mode and while browsing organizations, you can
access each organization's individual groups by highlighting that
organization and pressing O. This will spill open the organization window,
showing you all of the groups within that organization.

From there, scroll down and select a group, then press [] to bring up
the following menu:

   1. Top (return to top of menu)
   2. Open/close all
   3. Create new:
         Organization
         Group
   4. Switch (reorder group within organization)
   5. Edit Name
   6. Change Attribute:
         Baby
         Neutral
         Heel
   7. Delete

WRESTLER EDIT

 +====+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++====+
 +====+++++++ VERY IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT WRESTLER CREATION!!! +++++++=====+
 +====+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++====+
 +                                                                       +
 +  Once you have selected a organization AND a group, ONLY THEN you     +
 +  are ready to create a custom wrestler! Note that all wrestlers       +
 +  MUST exist within either a new or preexisting group. If you create   +
 +  an entirely new organization (i.e. WWE), you MUST first create       +
 +  group within that organization (i.e. RAW, SmackDown!), THEN create   +
 +  your wrestler within their appropriate group. Please understand      +
 +  this before attempting to create your own wrestler!!!                +
 +                                                                       +
 +====++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=====+
 +====++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=====+

To begin creating a wrestler, highlight a group and press X to enter the
group window. If default wrestlers are in this group, you will also
be able to select and edit them from here (name and one appearance only).
If this is a newly created group, you will only see one option in the
window, &quot;Create New&quot;, which will allow you to create a new wrestler for
this faction.

 ++ NOTE: You CANNOT create a new wrestler by selecting an organization,
 ++ you MUST select a group within that organization. If you're trying to
 ++ create a new wrestler and are getting a &quot;buzzing&quot; sound instead, make
 ++ sure that you have selected an actual group, not just an organization.

To create a new wrestler within a group with preexisting wrestlers,
simply highlight any wrestler within that group, then press [] to bring
up the following screen:

   1. Top (return to top of menu)
   2. NEW:
         Model Wrestler (start from an existing model)
         Default Wrestler (start from scratch)
   3. Switch (reorder selected wrestler within group)
   4. Transfer (change selected wrestler's group/organization)
   5. Edit Name
   6. Delete

If you're creating a wrestler within an empty group, pressing X will
bring you directly to the &quot;Create New Wrestler&quot; option. Obviously, not all
of the options above are available if there is no existing wrestler to
edit within the group.

CREATING A NEW WRESTLER
When you first create your wrestler, you will be presented with two
options:

   1. Model Wrestler (start from an existing model)
   2. Default Wrestler (start from scratch)

&quot;Model Wrestler&quot; allows you to choose one of the default or previously
created wrestlers as a base for a new wrestler. This may be useful for
making alternate versions of a wrestler under a different gimmick or
style, or tag team members with similar attire.

The Model Wrestler's name, appearance, statistical information under Skill
Edit, moves, and CPU Logic will all be loaded. However, anything in Skill
Edit that uses points (Special Skill, Body Part endurance, etc.) as well
as the Parameter Edit (Attribute Points) will not be loaded, so you will
have to manually fill those in.

&quot;Default Wrestler&quot; will allow you to select the name for your wrestler,
you can then alter his other features later.

Here is an overview of the naming display:

[Short Name][Long Name][Flip: On/Off][Separator Type][Nickname]

Flip: Used to determine whether the Short Name or Long Name will come
first, which is convenient for wrestlers whose first name contains more
characters than their last.

Separator: This determines what character will come in between the two
names. There aren't enough spaces for many names when naming in English,
so this is very useful. For example, if a wrestler's name is very long
(i.e. Undertaker), you can enter it separately, then choose the last
separator (none) to merge Short Name and Long Name together.

Use L1 and R1 to advance through the various fields. Initially the
&quot;nickname&quot; option is off-screen, until you toggle to it by pressing R1.

Once you have assigned a name to your wrestler, press Start to complete
the naming process. Here you will be presented with three options:

   Exit (confirm changes)
   Exit (cancel changes)
   Cancel (return to window)

EDITING YOUR NEWLY CREATED WRESTLER
After you've completed the naming process, your new wrestler will appear
in his or her appropriate faction. From there, select the wrestler and
press X to bring up the following options:

Recovery
Recovery Power is the wrestler's overall physical stamina, or &quot;life bar&quot;.
It is a very important setting, obviously, though you can't really tell by
the name. The higher this setting, the higher the wrestler's maximum
stamina and the faster his stamina recharges when the wrestler isn't being
attacked. By this reasoning, getting cut open early on can be very
devastating to a wrestler who has higher normal Recovery power than he has
bleeding Recovery power. His maximum stamina would take a rather large
hit. +LV+

    2 - Medium........................Cost:  6 Points

    2 - Medium........................Cost:  3 Points

Breathing
Lower breathing makes a wrestler get tired faster. Each wrestler has an
energy level, the maximum and regeneration rate of which is controlled by
this statistic. Each attack you throw consumes some of your energy. Your
movement speed will gradually drop as your energy level does. Breathing
recharges this energy level; to my knowledge this is the only one of the
three gauges you can manually recharge. +LV+

Spirit (Willpower, Awareness)
Spiritual Strength represents mental endurance - the higher it is, the
longer it takes to &quot;break&quot; the wrestler and make him mentally give up the
match, which results in either a pin or submission. This ability also
helps offset the physical damage you take (Recovery) and the amount of
fatigue you incur (Breathing) during the match. Spirit is also a factor in
determining if your character hits a reversal.

Stretch holds are the best way to damage Spirit. Heelish moves, such as
the eye gouge and groin attacks, also tend to do large amounts of Spirit
damage. +LV+

APPEARANCE EDIT
&quot;Layering&quot; was first introduced in Fire Pro Z, and has been expanded upon
in Fire Pro R with the all-new face/head layering option. Whereas previous
versions of Fire Pro only allowed you to choose from a variety of premade
heads (you could still recolor them), Fire Pro R allows you to layer masks
and hairstyles to create just about anyone you can possibly imagine!

From the Appearance Menu, you are presented with the following options,
which will be described in detail below:

   Overall.......Choose from &quot;custom&quot; or 59 presets

   Upper Arm.....Choose and adjust upper arm design
   Lower Arm.....Choose and adjust lower arm design
   Thigh.........Choose and adjust thigh design
   Calf..........Choose and adjust calf design
   Feet..........Choose and adjust feet design

OVERALL
This allows you to choose from 59 &quot;pre-built&quot; wrestlers, good for using as
a starting point (i.e. you want a wrestler with long pants, wrist bands
and no shirt, load up preset #6 and go from there).

 ++ NOTE: When creating pro wrestlers, it's important to keep their
 ++ overall status in mind. For example, main eventers' point totals
 ++ should be much higher than mid or undercarders, and their overall
 ++ point totals should reflect their in-ring success in worked matches
 ++ rather than their actual in-ring ability. In the case of some
 ++ promotions, a wrestler's status may reflect his or her actual in-ring
 ++ ability, but this is the exception, not the rule.

 ++ Most pre-made lower/mid-carders are assigned a total of around 110 to
 ++ 150 points, and it's recommended that you stay consistent with that
 ++ range when making these types of wrestlers. On the average, junior
 ++ wrestlers' point totals should be lower than their heavyweight
 ++ counterparts, as to reflect their perceived lack of success in a head
 ++ to-head confrontation. Shoot fighters' points should also be logically
 ++ assigned.

CPU LOGIC
CPU Logic determines a wrestler's tendencies by percentages when
controlled by the computer. This is a popular feature used to create
accurate edits for simulating dream matches and e-feds, and a defining
aspect of the Fire Pro series. Not only can you create a wrestler with
his or her own appearance and moveset, but their own basic match
psychology as well.

For serious Fire Pro enthusiasts, a great deal of time can be spent
tweaking the options below. And although full comprehension of CPU Logic
adjustment is by no means a prequisite to enjoying the game, it is
recommended for those who want the full Fire Pro experience.

Note that individual moves can actually be changed (but not previewed) in
the &quot;Name of Move&quot; column.

*Priority Attacks*
Priority is an all-new option to Fire Pro CPU Logic, and it basically
denotes a set of moves a wrestler may attempt in sequence in order to
finish a match. Note that you cannot preview these moves from here, so
unless you know what they are by name, this may be confusing.

=Personality Traits=

 ++ NOTE: For some inexplicable reason, Spike decided to invert the
 ++ values for Personality Traits in FPR, so what was previously &quot;Low&quot;
 ++ is now &quot;High&quot;, and vice versa. Add to this Agetec's own &quot;Yes&quot; or
 ++ &quot;No&quot; translation and you have one confusing scenario. For the sake
 ++ of reference, just remember that &quot;Yes&quot; = &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;No&quot; = &quot;High&quot;.
 
*Personal Traits (Entertainment)*
A high percentage here represents the character's willingness and effort
to put on an entertaining match for the fans, which sometimes means being
on the receiving end of a beating. Low percentages result in wrestlers who
act more like shootfighters, going for the win and nothing else.

Wrestlers need a high entertainment percentage if they are supposed to be
doing top rope moves and suicide dives. They tend to be very aggressive in
their attacks, but as a result don't stop to rest as often. Lower
percentages make the wrestler stick to mat wrestling and generally
wrestle a &quot;smarter&quot; match. They don't take a lot of risks and don't attack
as aggressively, but they do tend to last longer since they rest more.

A character that is being made as a professional wrestler should NEVER
have a low percentage here. The vast majority of all Spike-made wrestlers
have between 0/100 and 30/70 on this percentage - this is the range all
professional wrestler edits should fall in. In general, the lower you go
below 30/70, the less enjoyable the character is to watch. +LV+

*Discretion*
This percentage controls how long a match lasts and how much of a priority
the character places on winning. The lower this percentage is, the more
your wrestler is concerned with inflicting damage on the opponent. The
higher it is, the more he attempts to win. The majority of the Spike
created pro wrestlers have 35/65 in this category, which is a good median
between wanting to win and dealing damage to your opponent.

Professional wrestlers CAN have low percentages here - many Spike-created
heelish or wild wrestlers who care very little for the win/loss result of
their match have a low percentage, around 80/20. Mr. Pogo and Mitsuhiro
Matsunaga, both infamous for their disregard for their opponent's safety
and of match results, have 0/100. +LV+
 
*Flexibility*
This percentage determines how much the character will stray from his own
&quot;game plan&quot;, or the logic settings you give him for his moves, in order to
have a good match with his opponent. A character with 0/100 will change
whatever is necessary in order to put on a good match, whereas a character
with 100/0 will never go off the logic settings you have put in for him.

Pro wrestlers are all over the board with this setting, but the majority
are set high, between 0/100 and 20/80. Low flexibility is one of the
defining characteristics of shootfighters and will make your edit act more
shootish in general. A low setting here will typically result in inferior
matches. +LV+
 
*Cooperation*
Used for tag matches. When this percentage is set higher, the wrestler is
more likely to do double team moves and work with his or her partner.

=Other Tendencies=

*Outside Return Count*
How long the wrestler will stay outside the ring before going back in.
 
*Touchwork*
How long before the wrestler will tag a partner in during a tag match
(based on the amount of damage taken).
 
*Weapons*
How likely the wrestler will get and use weapons.
 
*Second/Manager*
Likelihood of a second (or manager) interfering during a match.

FINISHER NAME
Assign a name to your finisher. Note that choosing a new finisher in a
wrestler's moveset will automatically delete whatever you may have entered
here previously.

PROFILE
A small line of info about the wrestler. Use L1/R1 to toggle between the

=======================
==SECTION 11: CREDITS==
=======================
As stated earlier, this document simply would not exist were it not for
the contributions of numerous individuals within the Fire Pro community.
In particular, the Icemaster (Frank Chan) deserves much of the credit for
the impetus behind this guide. Many of the words herein are his, not mine.
Thank you, whereever you may be!

I need to give special thanks to Jason Blackhart and Dave Fairbairn, both
of whom are blazing new trails when it comes to the understanding of the
inner workings of the Fire Pro Wrestling. Thanks to these two, my
knowledge (and since it is shared in this guide, your knowledge) about
this fantastic series continues to grow by leaps and bounds.

Also, special thanks to Muka, who was not only the source behind much of
the early pre-release info concerning FPR, but a continual provider of
knowledge regarding game conventions and options.

Finally, a huge amount of thanks to Lord Vermin, who graciously took the
time to contact me and give me permission to use his valuable information
for this guide. Those detailed logic descriptions are his words, not mine,
as I felt his explanations were flawless. The community as a whole owes
you a lot for what you've given us over the years!

Much credit, thanks and respect also go out to:
