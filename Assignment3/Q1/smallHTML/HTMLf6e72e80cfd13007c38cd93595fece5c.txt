This multi-sport athletic star holds 14 national records in his age classification in a plethora of different track and field events. His athletic ability is off the charts, so much so, that he also dominates at basketball, football, soccer and now he is working hard to be a top-notch swimmer. This would be a conventional story if Ezra was a conventional young athlete, but he is exceptional in all facets of life. Ezra was born with congenital limb differences, missing his left knee, left fibula and the fingers on his left hand. When he was two and a half years old, he had surgery at Boston Children’s Hospital that changed his life forever. Ezra had the non-functioning part lower part of his left leg removed and a toe to hand transplant from the amputated foot to his left hand.  After follow up surgery and intensive hours of occupational and physical therapy, Ezra was able to continue to pursue his dreams of being the best athlete he could be.  He has loved sports since the time he was able to crawl and the young star hasn’t looked back. On top of all of the sports he is currently playing, he participated in karate, casually learned to skateboard and occasionally plays golf.  In 2013, Ezra won the Courage Award at Kobe’s Basketball Academy and the very next year in 2014 he was announced as a finalist for Sports Illustrated’s prestigious SportsKid of the Year award.  Today, Ezra’s not only extremely active in sports, but he serves as motivational speaker to raise awareness and understanding for the physically challenged. His ultimate goal is to be a paralympian and is already training as an 11-year-old for the 2020 Tokyo Paralympic games.  On top of all of this, he and his family focus on fundraising for the para-sport cause, but they are actively building up Paralympic sports teaming up with UCLA to develop Angel City Sports and the Angel City Games (http://angelcitysports.org/). For more information on Ezra’s story, please visit his page: http://www.teamezra.com/. Special thanks goes out to UCLA, the Brentwood School and the Sterling Basketball Academy for the assistance in the making of this video.
