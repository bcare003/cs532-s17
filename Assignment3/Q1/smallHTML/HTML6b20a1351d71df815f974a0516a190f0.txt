                              <p>The <B>raccoon</B> (<I>Procyon lotor</I>) is a native mammal, measuring about 3 feet long,   including its 12-inch, bushy, ringed tail. Because their hind legs are longer   than the front legs, raccoons have a hunched appearance when they walk or run.   Each of their front feet has five dexterous toes, allowing raccoons to grasp and   manipulate food and other items (Fig. 1).   
                              <p>Raccoons prefer forest areas   near a stream or water source, but have adapted to various environments   throughout Washington. Raccoon populations can get quite large in urban areas,   owing to hunting and trapping restrictions, few predators, and human-supplied   food.   
                              <p>Adult raccoons weigh 15 to   40 pounds, their weight being a result of genetics, age, available food, and   habitat location. Males have weighed in at over 60 pounds. A raccoon in the wild   will probably weigh less than the urbanized raccoon that has learned to live on   handouts, pet food, and garbage-can leftovers.   
                              <p>As long as raccoons are kept   out of human homes, not cornered, and not treated as pets, they are not   dangerous.

                                  <LI>Raccoons also eat insects,   slugs, dead animals, birds and bird eggs, as well as fruits, vegetables, nuts,   and seeds. Around humans, raccoons often eat garbage and pet food.   
                                  <LI>Although not great hunters,   raccoons can catch young gophers, squirrels, mice, and rats.   
                                  <LI>Except during the breeding   season and for females with young, raccoons are solitary. Individuals will eat   together if a large amount of food is available in an area. </LI>

                                  <LI>In urban areas, raccoons   normally use den sites as daytime rest sites. In wooded areas, they often rest   in trees.   
                                  <LI>Raccoons generally move to   different den or daytime rest site every few days and do not follow a   predictable pattern. Only a female with young or an animal &ldquo;holed up&rdquo; during a   cold spell will use the same den for any length of time. Several raccoons may   den together during winter storms. </LI>

                                  <LI>Raccoons pair up only   during the breeding season, and mating occurs as early as January to as late as   June. The peak mating period is March to April.   
                                  <LI>After a 65-day gestation   period, two to three kits are born.   
                                  <LI>The kits remain in the den   until they are about seven weeks old, at which time they can walk, run, climb,   and begin to occupy alternate dens.   
                                  <LI>At eight to ten weeks of   age, the young regularly accompany their mother outside the den and forage for   them selves. By 12 weeks, the kits roam on their own for several nights before   returning to their mother.   
                                  <LI>The kits remain with their   mother in her home range through winter, and in early spring seek out their own   territories.   
                                  <LI>The size of a raccoon&rsquo;s   home range as well as its nightly hunting area varies greatly depending on the   habitat and food supply. Home range diameters of 1 mile are known to occur in   urban areas. </LI>

                                <p>Raccoons can be seen   throughout the year, except during extremely cold periods. Usually observed at   night, they are occasionally seen during the day eating or napping in a tree or   searching elsewhere for food. Coastal raccoons take advantage of low tides and   are seen foraging on shellfish and other food by day. </p>
                                <p><B>Trails </B></p>
                                <p>Raccoons use trails made by   other wildlife or humans next to creeks, ravines, ponds, and other water   sources. Raccoons often use culverts as a safe way to cross under roads. With a   marsh on one side of the road and woods on the other, a culvert becomes their   chief route back and forth. Look for raccoon tracks in sand, mud, or soft soil   at either end of the culvert. </p>
                                <p>In developed areas, raccoon   travel along fences, next to buildings, and near food sources.</p>

Tracks may appear as smudge   marks on the side of a house where a raccoon shimmies up and down a downspout or   utility pipe. </p>
                                <p>Sharp, nonretractable claws   and long digits make raccoons good climbers. Like squirrels, raccoons can rotate   their hind feet 180 degrees and descend trees headfirst. (Cats&rsquo; claws don&rsquo;t   rotate and they have to back down trees.) Look for scratch marks on trees and   other structures that raccoons climb. </p>
                                <p>Look for wear marks, body   oil, and hairs on wood and other rough surfaces, particularly around the edges   of den entrances. The den&rsquo;s entrance hole is usually at least 4 inches high and   6 inches wide.</p>

                                <p>Raccoon droppings are   crumbly, flat-ended, and can contain a variety of food items. The length is 3 to   5 inches, but this is usually broken into segments. The diameter is about the   size of the end of your little finger. </p>
                                <p>Raccoons leave droppings on   logs, at the base of trees, and on roofs (raccoons defecate before climbing   trees and entering structures). Raccoons create toilet areas&mdash;inside and outside   structures&mdash;away from the nesting area. House cats have similar habits. </p>

                                <p><B>Don&rsquo;t feed raccoons.</B> <BR>
                                  Feeding raccoons may create undesirable situations for you, your children,   neighbors, pets, and the raccoons themselves. Raccoons that are fed by people   often lose their fear of humans and may become aggressive when not fed as   expected. Artificial feeding also tends to concentrate raccoons in a small area;   overcrowding can spread diseases and parasites. Finally, these hungry visitors   might approach a neighbor who doesn&rsquo;t share your appreciation of the animals.   The neighbor might choose to remove these raccoons, or have them   removed.</p>
                                <p><B>Don&rsquo;t give raccoons   access to garbage.</B> <BR>
                                  Keep your garbage can lid on tight by securing it   with rope, chain, bungee cords, or weights. Better yet, buy garbage cans with   clamps or other mechanisms that hold lids on. To prevent tipping, secure side   handles to metal or wooden stakes driven into the ground. Or keep your cans in   tight-fitting bins, a shed, or a garage. Put garbage cans out for pickup in the   morning, after raccoons have returned to their resting areas.</p>
                                <p><B>Feed dogs and cats   indoors and keep them in at night.</B> <BR>
                                  If you must feed your pets outside,   do so in late morning or at midday, and pick up food, water bowls, leftovers,   and spilled food well before dark every day. </p>
                                <p><B>Keep pets indoors at   night.</B> <BR>
                                  If cornered, raccoons may attack dogs and cats. Bite wounds from   raccoons can result in fractures and disease transmission.</p>

                                  Keep indoor pet food and any other food away from a   pet door. Lock the pet door at night. If it is necessary to have it remain open,   put an electronically activated opener on your pet&rsquo;s collar. <I><B>Note:</B></I> Floodlights or motion detector lights placed above the pet door to scare   raccoons are not long-term solutions.</p>
                                <p><B>Put food in secure   compost containers and clean up barbecue areas.</B> <BR>
                                  Don&rsquo;t put food of any kind in   open compost piles; instead, use a securely covered compost structure or a   commercially available raccoon-proof composter to prevent attracting raccoons   and getting exposed to their droppings. A covered worm box is another   alternative. If burying food scraps, cover them with at least 8 inches of soil   and don&rsquo;t leave any garbage above ground in the area&mdash;including the stinky   shovel. Placing a wire mesh barrier that is held in place with a heavy object   over the in-ground compost will prevent problems. </p>
                                <p><B>Clean barbecue grills and   grease traps thoroughly following each use.</B></p>
                                <p><B>Eliminate access to   denning sites.</B> <BR>
                                  Raccoons commonly use chimneys, attics, and spaces under   houses, porches, and sheds as den sites. Close any potential entries with &frac14;-inch   mesh hardware cloth, boards, or metal flashing. Make all connections flush and   secure to keep mice, rats, and other mammals out. Make sure you don&rsquo;t trap an   animal inside when you seal off a potential entry (see <A href="/living/nuisance/evicting.html">Evicting Animals from Buildings</A>).

                                      <p>If your disposal company   leaves dumpster lids open, install a sign telling employees that it&rsquo;s vital to   keep the lid closed so animals don&rsquo;t get trapped inside. Consider installing a   totally enclosed trash-compacting dumpster. The trash is deposited in the front   and regularly compacted.   
                                      <p>In spring and summer, a   female raccoon may be enticed into the dark, quiet, and secure environment of   your chimney for a nesting place.   
                                      <p>If you hear a large animal   on the roof, or growls and whines coming from the chimney at night, there is   probably a raccoon family inside. Using a powerful flashlight during the day,   look for a raccoon down the chimney. (If spider webs are strung across the   inside, you can be reasonably sure that no animal is using the chimney.)   
                                      <p>The easiest solution to   removing raccoons from a chimney is to wait for them to move on their own. After   eight to ten weeks the female and young will leave and not return.   
                                      <p>If raccoons need to be   evicted, do not smoke them out and do not pour anything, including naphtha   flakes or mothballs, down the chimney. Adult raccoons can easily climb out of a   chimney, but the babies can&rsquo;t. The concentrated vapors can also damage the   infant raccoons&rsquo; mucous membranes and make an adult raccoon extremely agitated   while attempting to flee from the vapors.   
                                      <p>Instead, harass the adult   female using the following methods until being there is no longer worth her   effort. She will move her young to an alternate den, one by one, holding them by   the back of the neck in her mouth.<I><B> Note:</B></I> Any time you try to evict   any mother animal, there is a chance that she may leave some or all of the   babies behind.

                                  Raccoons are attracted to   ponds because they associate them with a food source. While a motion-activated   light or sprinkler, or your shouting may scare off a raccoon, this is usually   temporary. A raccoon, especially an urban raccoon, may run away the first night,   walk away the second night, but, if there&rsquo;s no additional deterrent, by the   third or fourth night the animal will be back with the light shining brightly or   the sprinkler sprinkling strongly. </p>
                                <p>Always give fish a safe   place to hide by constructing hiding places on the bottom of the pond. Use   cinder blocks, ceramic drain tile, wire baskets, or upside-down plastic crates   held in place with heavy rocks. </p>
                                <p>To prevent raccoons from   disturbing aquatic plants in containers, use containers that are too heavy or   wide for raccoons to overturn. Securing chicken wire over the top of the   containers will prevent raccoons from disturbing the soil inside. </p>
                                <p>Although it&rsquo;s awkward   looking, small ponds can be completely covered with a barrier that can be left   on permanently or removed daily.</p>
                                <p>Since raccoons are most   active after dark, be sure the pond is covered at night. Examples of barriers   include one-inch mesh chicken wire laid over the surface and held in place with   stakes&mdash;raccoons will walk on the barrier and try and go under it. (While black   bird-netting is less conspicuous, raccoons and other animals can easily get   entangled in it.) A wooden or PVC pipe frame covered with wire mesh can also be   built to cover the pond. Maneuvering over pond plants with any of the above can   be difficult. </p>
                                <p>An alternative frame can be   constructed from heavy plastic lattice available from home improvement centers.   Carefully cut the lattice so it fits in the pond; cut out pieces to accommodate   any pond plants. Cover the lattice with bird netting (with the solid backing,   animals are less likely to become entangled in the netting). The netting can be   glued to the lattice using Shoe Goo&reg; or other waterproof glue. </p>
                                <p>For larger ponds, stake   2-foot wide strips of chicken wire flat around the inside of the pond edge where   raccoons are entering. (Cut the wire as needed to match the curvature of the   pond.) Raccoons will have difficulty reaching over the wire, and will tend to   not stand on it because of its instability. To camouflage and extend the life of   the wire, spray it with dark-colored automobile undercoat paint or other   rustproof paint. </p>

                                <p>Trapping and relocating a   raccoon several miles away seems an appealing method of resolving a conflict   because it is perceived as giving the &ldquo;problem animal&rdquo; a second chance in a new   home. Unfortunately, the reality of the situation is quite different. Raccoons   typically try to return to their original territories, often getting hit by a   car or killed by a predator in the process. If they remain in the new area, they   may get into fights (oftentimes to the death) with resident raccoons for limited   food, shelter, or nesting sites. Raccoons may also transmit diseases to rural   populations that they have picked up from urban pets. Finally, if a place &ldquo;in   the wild&rdquo; or an urban green space is perfect for raccoons, raccoons are probably   already there. It isn&rsquo;t fair to the animals already living there to release   another competitor into their home range. </p>
                                <p>Raccoons used to a   particular food source, type of shelter, or human activity will seek out   familiar situations and surroundings. People, organizations, or agencies that   illegally move raccoons should be willing to assume liability for any damages or   injuries caused by these animals. Precisely for these reasons, raccoons posing a   threat to human and pet safety should not be relocated. </p>
                                <p>In many cases, moving   raccoons will not solve the original problem because other raccoons will replace   them and cause similar conflicts. Hence, it is more effective to make the site   less attractive to raccoons than it is to routinely trap them. </p>
                                <p>Trapping also may not be   legal in some urban areas; check with local authorities. Transporting animals   without the proper permit is also unlawful in most cases (see "<A href="#legal">Legal Status</A>"). See <A href="/living/nuisance/trapping.html" >Trapping Wildlife</A> for information on trapping   raccoons.</p>

                                <p>Lethal control is a last   resort and can never be justified without first applying the above-described   nonlethal control techniques. Lethal control is rarely a long-term solution   since other raccoons are likely to move in if food, water, or shelter remains   available. </p>
                                <p>If all efforts to dissuade a   problem raccoon fail, the animal may have to be trapped. See <A href="/living/nuisance/trapping.html" >Trapping Wildlife</A> for information on   trapping raccoons. </p>
                                <p>While shooting can be   effective in eliminating a single raccoon, it is generally limited to rural   situations. Shooting is considered too hazardous in more populated areas, even   if legal. (See "<A href="#legal">Legal Status</A>" for important   information.)</p>

                                <p>A disease that contributes   significantly to raccoon mortality is canine distemper. Canine distemper is also   a common disease fatal to domestic dogs, foxes, coyotes, mink, otters, weasels,   and skunks. It is caused by a virus and is spread most often when animals come   in contact with the bodily secretions of animals infected with the disease.   Gloves, cages, and other objects that have come in contact with infected animals   can also contain the virus. The best prevention against canine distemper is to   have your dogs vaccinated and kept away from raccoons. </p>
                                <p>Raccoons in Washington often   have roundworms (like domestic dogs and cats do, but from a different worm).   Raccoon roundworm does not usually cause a serious problem for raccoons.   However, roundworm eggs shed in raccoon droppings can cause mild to serious   illness in other animals and humans. Although rarely documented anywhere in the   United States, raccoon roundworm can infect a person who accidentally ingests or   inhales the parasite&rsquo;s eggs. </p>
                                <p>Prevention consists of never   touching or inhaling raccoon droppings, using rubber gloves and a mask when   cleaning areas (including traps) that have been occupied by raccoons, and   keeping young children and pets away from areas where raccoons concentrate. (If   washing raccoon droppings from a roof, watch where the liquid matter is going.)   Routinely encourage or assist your children to wash their hands after playing   outdoors. Unfortunately, raccoon roundworm eggs can remain alive in soil and   other places for several months. </p>
                                <p>If a person is bitten or   scratched by a raccoon, immediately scrub the wound with soap and water. Flush   the wound liberally with tap water. In other parts of the United States raccoons   can carry rabies. Contact your physician and the local health department   immediately. If your pet is bitten, follow the same cleansing procedure and   contact your veterinarian.</p>

                                <p>Because legal status,   trapping restrictions, and other information about raccoons change, contact your <A href="/about/regions/">WDFW Regional   Office</A> for updates. </p>
                                <p>The raccoon is classified as   both a furbearer and a game animal (<A href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=232-12-007" >WAC   232-12-007</A>). A hunting or trapping license is required to hunt or trap   raccoons during an open season. A property owner or the owner&rsquo;s immediate   family, employee, or tenant may kill or trap a raccoon on that property if it is   damaging crops or domestic animals (<A href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=77.36.030" >RCW   77.36.030</A>). In such cases, no permit is necessary for the use of live (cage)   traps. However, a special trapping permit is required for the use of all traps   other than live traps (<A href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=77.15.192" >RCW 77.15.192</A>, <A href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=77.15.194" >77.15.194</A>; <A href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=232-12-142" >WAC   232-12-142</A>). </p>
                                <p>It is unlawful to release   wildlife anywhere within the state, other than on the property where it was   legally trapped, without a permit to do so (<A href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=77.15.250" >RCW 77.15.250</A>; <A href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=232-12-271" >WAC 232-12-271</A>). Except for bona fide public or private   zoological parks, persons and entities are prohibited from importing raccoons   into Washington State without a permit to do so (<A href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=246-100-191" >WAC   246-100-191</A>).</p>
