Q2: -4

way too many details left out here.  where is your code to
get the follower info?  what is your twitter account?
there is no way to verify any of this.  upload your code
and your account info and I'll give the points back.

I don't see you on this graph either.

Explanation: In my report I noted that I had acquired exactly 50 followers on my 
twitter account, bryancarey432. Since 50 was a small enough number, and it was not 
specified how we were to do so, I simply went through my followers manually and typed 
up a .txt file, followers.txt. with the number of followers each of my followers had.
I chose to do so because of the low volume of followers, and in my mind it was much 
quicker to do so than creating a program to do so.
