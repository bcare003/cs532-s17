After further thought, I realized that Dr. Nelson would probably want an analysis of problem 2, 
in addition to the graphs generated and what exactly they mean.When the group is split into three,
10 becomes isolated by itself as it is the most loosely linked component in the graph in terms of 
the connections to the other nodes. Within the group centralized around 1 there is a visual divide-
one link holding 1 and 11 toghther. This was a clear indicator to me of where the next divide would occur.

Upon splitting into four, my suspicion was confirmed. The graph indeed split where I had predicted. The exact
same phenomenon occured with nodes 3 and 9. From this I could predict the next split. The final group listings
will be 1{2,4, 8, 12, 13, 14, 18, 20, 22}, 34{9, 15, 19, 21, 23, 24, 27, 30, 33}, {5, 6, 7, 11, 17}, 
{3, 25, 26, 28, 29, 32}, & {10}.

After conducting the final split my prediction was once again proved correct. Within each graph there were several
clusters, and each split using edge betweenness elimanted the most loosely connected nodes. This resulted in the
individuals who weren't as close to other members of the club to become more isolated with each split.
